## F.A.Q.

### How can I join Virtual Coffee?

#### 1. Attend one of our Coffees (Zoom Meetings)

{% leadText %}

You need to attend one of [Coffees (Zoom Meetings)](</member-resources/guide-to-vc/#coffees-(zoom-meetings)>) on **Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET** or **Thursday at 12:00 PM ET** that last an hour.

{% endleadText %}

We absolutely love the closeness of this community and know itâ€™s one of the many things that sets us apart. This closeness starts with those coffees.
We would also like to give you the experience of Virtual Coffee in person before we move to Slack group.

[Sign up and RSVP for a Coffee](https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee) and get the link to our Zoom.

#### 2. Complete the registration form ðŸ˜Š

Our MC will drop the link of the New Member Form together with the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) and other links during the intro of Coffee. The New Member Form will be dropped again at the end of the session.

Grab the form, fill it in, and submit it. Then, you will be given access to our Slack group.

#### 3. So now youâ€™re in our Slack! Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

You can introduce yourself in this channel. We would love to know who you are, where you are in your tech journey, and what you enjoy outside of tech!

### What is going on in Coffees?

Weâ€™re getting to know other members, old and new, through casual conversations on Zoom. We prioritize empathy, encouraging everyone to participate in the ways that are most comfortable to them, and learning together.
Check out our [Guide To Virtual Coffee](/member-resources/guide-to-vc/) for more details.

### Are there any other days and times for Coffees?

Not yet, but we're working on it!

### Iâ€™m an introvert. Would it be okay to turn off my camera during Coffees?

If you aren't comfortable having your camera or even sound on, feel free to turn them off! There is no obligation for you to have them on. You can always drop chat if itâ€™s more convenient for you. We want you to be as comfortable as possible in our coffees.

### Iâ€™m a newbie. Can I still join Virtual Coffee?
