                  <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>We have twice weekly Zoom Meetings. Morning Crew Tuesday at 9:00 AM EDT and Afternoon Crowd on Thursday 12:00 PM EDT. They last about an hour. We want everyone to be casual and comforatble. We meet in the main room for pre coffee chatter talk then move to breakout rooms. There we introduce ourselves with some standard questions.<ul>
                    <li>What's your name?</li>
                    <li>What you do?</li>
                    <li>Where you are you from?</li>
                    <li>What's your answer to the ice breaker question? This is nontech question to add some fun to the conversation. Past questions have been. "What's your favorite food?", "Who would play you in a movie?"</li>
                    <li>Each room will have a Room Lead and a Note Taker. Notes will later be shared in VC Slack.
                     <li> We go into a deeper dicussion on other tech related topics. The Room Lead will start the coversation. We usally have a preplanned topic but are also open to other thing the room wants to discuss. You can have camera on or off. We like to use the hand raise feature on Zoom. We love to see kids or pets.</li>
                     <li>Near the end of the hour we return to the main room for wrap up and announcements.</li>
                     <li>We share our Code of conduct and the link the membership application</li>
