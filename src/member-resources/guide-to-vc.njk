      Onboarding processes sometimes can be confusing, this is just as true for software as well as communities!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      We get many questions such as "I have some questions or ideas, how and where should I ask this?", "Do we have a channel for {something}?" or "how to find a channel in Slack?", "I would like to help, how to volunteer?" And many more!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      To give you the best experience, and to get the most out of Virtual Coffee, we created the official "Virtual Coffee Guide"!

    <h3 id="coffees">Coffees (Zoom Meetings)</h3>

    <p class="lead">
      We have twice weekly Coffees (Zoom Meetings) on
      <strong>Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET</strong> and
      <strong>Thursday at 12:00 PM ET</strong> that last for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a good place and time to meet and get to know other members, old
      and new, through casual conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the size of audiences, after some intro from the MC, we will
      break the crowd into breakout rooms so everybody can have a more relaxed
      and intimate atmosphere of conversations.
    </p>
    <p>You are here only to listen and chill? No problem!</p>
    <p>
      You cannot or are not comfortable having your camera or even sound on?
      Feel free to turn them off! There is no obligation for you to do so. We
      want these meetings to be as comfortable as possible for you.
    </p>
