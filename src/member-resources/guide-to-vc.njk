      Onboarding processes can be confusing. This is just as true for software as it is for communities!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      We get many questions such as "I have some questions or ideas; how and where should I ask this," "Do we have a channel for {something}," "How do I find a channel in Slack," "I would like to help, how do I volunteer?" And many more!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      To give you the best experience, and to get the most out of Virtual Coffee, we created the official "Virtual Coffee Guide"!

    <h2 id="code-of-conduct"><a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a></h2>
    <p>
      This is the most important part of Virtual Coffee. We want this community
      to be a welcoming, inclusive, supportive, and safe place for all our
      members.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
      experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or
      invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
      experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
      appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>We take our Code of Conduct seriously.</em> You can find <a href="/code-of-conduct/">a copy of
      it</a> on our website.
    </p>

    <h3>I think someone has violated the Code of Conduct. How can I report it?</h3>
    <p>
      You can report your experience to our Maintainers at hello@virtualcoffee.io or anonymously at

    <h3 id="coffees">Coffees (Zoom Meetings)</h3>

    <p class="lead">
      We have twice weekly Coffees (Zoom Meetings) on
      <strong>Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET</strong> and
      <strong>Thursday at 12:00 PM ET</strong> that last an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a good place and time to meet and get to know other members, old
      and new, through casual conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some pre-coffee chatter while people filter in, the Coffee MC will do an intro with some background and important announcements. Then we'll
      break the crowd into breakout rooms for more relaxed
      and intimate conversations.
    </p>
        <h4 id="coffees">How to Participate</h3>
        <p>When we move to the small group conversations, there will be a room leader and notetaker for the room. They'll explain how we do introductions and how to participate. We value all of our members and the ways they're most comfortable participating.</p>

    <p>If you're here to listen and chill? No problem!
      If you can't turn on your camera, or aren't comfortable having your camera or even sound on?
      Feel free to turn them off! There is no obligation for you to have them on. We
      want you to be as comfortable as possible in our coffees.
    </p>

    <h3 id="vc-events"><a href="/events">Virtual Coffee Events</a></h3>

    <p class="lead">
      Our members voluntarily hold events from members to members! Check out
      <a href="/events">our Events page</a> for a full listing.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="/monthlychallenges/">Monthly Challenges</a></h4>

    <p>
      Every month we hold a
      <a href="/monthlychallenges/">monthly challenge</a> which we encourage our
      members to participate in!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the month there would be an announcement on what we will do
      for the upcoming monthly challenge. Starting at the beginning of the
      month, members can update their progress in a Slackâ€™s channel that is
      provided special for monthly challenges.
    </p>

    <h4>Lunch & Learn</h4>

    <p>
      Lunch & Learns are hour-long events lead by our members. They
      can be traditional conference-style talk, panel discussion, question and
      answer, or a combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a member has a topic that they want to present as a Lunch & Learn,
      they can do so by filling out
      <a href="/lunch-and-learn-idea/">the Lunch & Learn Idea form</a>. A
      coordinator will reach out and get the talk scheduled and put on the events calendar.
    </p>

    <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>

    <p>
      Occasionally we hold Lightning Talk sessions. A group of members take
      turns presenting their talk in a 5-20 minutes time range. A Call for Proposals
      will be shared in Virtual Coffee Slack. This is a great way to try
      your hand at public speaking! We always provide mentorship for those who want it.
