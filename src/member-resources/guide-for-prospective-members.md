### How can I join Virtual Coffee? {.mt-3 .mb-4}

#### 1. Attend one of our Coffees (Zoom Meetings) {.mt-3 .mb-4}

{% leadText %}

You need to attend one of [Coffees (Zoom Meetings)](</member-resources/guide-to-vc/#coffees-(zoom-meetings)>) on **Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET** or **Thursday at 12:00 PM ET** that last an hour.

{% endleadText %}

We absolutely love the closeness of this community and know itâ€™s one of the many things that sets us apart. This closeness starts with those coffees.
We would also like to give you the experience of Virtual Coffee in person before we move to Slack group.

[Sign up and RSVP for a Coffee](https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee) and get the link to our Zoom.

#### 2. Complete the registration form ðŸ˜Š {.mt-5 .mb-4}

Our MC will drop the link of the New Member Form together with the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) and other links during the intro of Coffee. The New Member Form will be dropped again at the end of the session.

Grab the form, fill it in, and submit it. Then, you will be given access to our Slack group.

#### 3. So now youâ€™re in our Slack! Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ {.mt-5 .mb-4}

You can introduce yourself in this channel. We would love to know who you are, where you are in your tech journey, and what you enjoy outside of tech!
