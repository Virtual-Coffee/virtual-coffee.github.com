<h2 class="my-5">ðŸ“† What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>

<h3 class="font-italic">February Recap</h3>
<p>
	Monthly challenge -&gt;
	<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/feb-2022/"
		>All About Pairing!</a
	>
</p>
<p>
	We spent the month of February forming teams to share ideas and work on
	projects.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 font-italic">VC Phase Three</h3>
<p>
	Itâ€™s almost been two years since the first Virtual Coffee happened. Weâ€™ve met
	so many new friends, learned and grew together, and formed into the welcoming
	community we have today.
</p>
<p>
	As we move into this third year of Virtual Coffee, the maintainers--with the
	help of a team of invested community members--have made the decision to pause
	new membership while we work on finding the best ways to support our existing
	community and define what the new year will look like for us all.
</p>
<p>
	Weâ€™re very excited to be going into another year of Virtual Coffee with you
	all, taking on new challenges, and making space for everyone here.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 font-italic">A new way to join our meetings</h3>
<p>
	To make our internal events easier to discover and to standardize the process
	to join any Virtual Coffee event, you'll now check the announcements for a
	"Join Now" button before the event. You can also see our new and improved
	<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/events/">Virtual Coffee Events page</a> to
	see what official Virtual Coffee and member-led events we have going on every
	week!
</p>

	We all have something to share. And when we share with others, we both invite
