<h4 class="mt-4">
	üí° Monthly Theme &amp; Challenge:
	<a href="https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/dec-2021/"
		>Creative community challenge</a
	>!
</h4>
<p>
	Devs are more than just the code we write. This month is all about embracing
	self-expression. Give back to yourself by indulging in something just for fun.
	Share the art, music, poetry, sports, games, or any other hobbies that spark
	joy for you. We spend so much time grinding away on understanding things in
	the tech space. Let's make some space for the other parts of ourselves.
