This week we welcome Mark Noonan to the show to talk about how becoming a part of Civic Tech initiatives can help career changers to grow and help existing developers create opportunities for mentorship, support, and connection for those coming into tech.

Mark talks about his experience with [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as well as [Code for Atlanta](https://www.codeforatlanta.org/), and the $40,000 Hackathon his group won and donated to charity! He brings his experience as a career transitioner to the conversation and we look at how participating in Civic Tech can help you develop skills to be a better communicator and programmer. And you might hear a little bit about how we prefer our breakfast foods too ðŸ¥ž
