<h3>Show Notes:</h3>

<p>Dan and Bekah welcome Nick Taylor (Senior Software Engineer at Forem/DEV) to talk about his journey into tech, open source, and the importance of community. Nick talks about his journey through University and into tech, how the landscape of tech has changed with increased resources and community, and how his idea of "structured YOLO" has lead him to this point in his career. He talks about how his job at Forem and how the pandemic led to his livestreaming, where he tries to make coding as realistic as possible. His hour and a half livestreams focus on one issue, but realistically those issues won't be solved during that time. And that's ok, because coding takes time, and working through issues won't always be a simple solution. His approach to teaching includes learning as you go, which made him an amazing contributor, mentor, and maintainer for the Virtual Coffee Hacktoberfest Initiative. Every conversation with Nick is an interesting one, and this one isn't an exception.</p>
