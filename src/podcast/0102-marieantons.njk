<h3>Show Notes:</h3>

<p>
	In this episode, Marie Antons talks with Dan, Bekah, and Kirk about how she
	went from being a chef to a junior developer. With more and more developers
	coming into tech from non-traditional backgrounds, Marie shares her own unique
	story and how taking her past experience as a chef allowed her to understand
	coding in her own way. There are ingredients and steps to follow with recipes,
	and similarly, as you learn to code, you'll find what you need to get your
	code to work and the process you need to take to get there. She also talks
	about the challenges of coming into her first job from a bootcamp, and what
	she wishes she would've known before starting that job.
