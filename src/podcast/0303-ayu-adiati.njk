<h3>Show Notes:</h3>

<p>
	In this episode, Dan and Bekah talk to Ayu about the impact of community,
	being a prolific blogger, and the very real challenge of burnout. Ayu's
	openness about the challenges of being a mom on the self-taught track into
	tech, isolation, and fears of not being good enough are the stories that we
	don't share enough of. Because when we share, we can all work through them
	together. Thank you, Ayu, for reminding us that it's ok to not be ok.
