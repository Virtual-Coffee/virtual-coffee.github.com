<h3>Show Notes:</h3>

<p>
	In this episode, Vic talks about Indie Hacking and gives us his take on when
	to ship, what to focus on, and the value of diverse opinions in your
	community. He also talks about treating life as a lot of drafts and about
	building things that you're passionate about as well as things that others
	find valuable. He cautions against the danger of survivorship bias,
	recognizing that it's difficult to find a path in indie hacking and that many
	of the popular voices have worked through challenges and no longer effectively
	represent how difficult it is to create a product that's successful.
