00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Hello, and
welcome to Season One, Episode

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,340
Five of the Virtual Coffee
Podcast. I'm Bekah, and this is

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,520
a podcast that features members
of the Virtual Coffee community.

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,670
Virtual Coffee is an intimate
group of developers at all

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,300
stages of their coding journey.
And they're here on this podcast

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,330
sharing their stories and what
they've learned. And we're here

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,690
to share it with you. Here with
me today is my co host, Dan.

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,980
Dan Ott: Thanks, Bekah. Today on
this episode, you'll hear from

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,370
Rahat Chowdhury, and Cameron
Bardell. Rahat is a

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,640
second-career developer mental
health advocate, live coding

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,700
streamer and a rapper. He is
also the founder of a mental

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,940
health startup called Whimser,
which is aimed at providing

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,140
tools to help keep up your
mental health. Cameron is an iOS

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,380
developer in the healthcare
industry from Waterloo, Ontario.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,440
He is also in the final stages
of an undergraduate degree in

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,340
physics and computer science. In
this episode, we talk about

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,070
building mental health projects
balancing mental health with

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,610
careers and life and how mental
health recovery isn't linear.

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,100
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: We start
every episode of the podcast

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,860
like we start every Virtual
Coffee: we introduce ourselves

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,000
with our name, where we're from,
what we do, and a random check

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,350
in question. Today's question
is, if you had to choose one

23
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,110
song for karaoke, what would it
be?

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,040
Hey, I'm Bekah. I'm a front end
developer from a small town in

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,530
Ohio. And if I could sing one
song for karaoke, it would be no

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,090
time left for you by The Guess
Who?

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,340
Dan Ott: Nice. Hi, I'm Dan. I'm
a front end developer from

28
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:06,000
Cleveland, Ohio. I would if I
could sing any karaoke song. I

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,640
think anything about cake is
like really in my wheelhouse.

30
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,130
Both, you know, I like the music
and his register kind of matches

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,160
mine. So I think pretty much
anything by cake. And I would

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,270
just see what they have and pick
one.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,810
Rahat Chowdhury: Hey, I'm Rahat,
a software engineer from New

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,650
York. If I had to pick one song
for karaoke, I guess it would be

35
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,720
I don't want to miss the thing.
Because I am a new dad. And I've

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,790
been obsessed with my daughter
for the past month. So yeah.

37
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,710
Dan Ott: That's a good one.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,000
Cameron Bardell: That's better
than when I got. I'm Cameron.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,380
I'm an iOS developer from
Waterloo, Ontario. And my go to

40
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,750
karaoke song is smile by uncle
cracker.

41
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,400
Dan Ott: Nice.

42
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,520
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Awesome.
Well, thank you both for being

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,550
here. We're very excited to have
you on today to talk about

44
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,880
mental health tech, both have
been working on some really cool

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,170
projects that we're excited to
talk about. But before we get

46
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,500
there, I always like to do a
little bit of the origin story.

47
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,820
And so can you talk about that
maybe Cameron, if you want to

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,450
talk first and tell us how you
got into tech and then Rahat.

49
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,290
That would be awesome.

50
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,450
Cameron Bardell: Sure, yeah. I
was always like, it's kind of a

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,200
techie kid. And then, but I
didn't do any real programming

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,980
until I got to high school. So I
think it was in about grade 10

53
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,310
when I took my first intro to
programming course, which was

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,040
all in Python. And my, my
teacher, that course, who was a

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,230
really good guy who I still talk
to you sometimes he was my

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,690
computer science and physics
teacher in high school. And now

57
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,300
I do computer science and
physics. So you can see where

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,880
that came from. He just noticed
that I was taking a bit of extra

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,090
interest in he pulled me aside
and said, Would you like to find

60
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,120
some extra projects to work on?
And I said, Yeah, so he sent me

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,530
down to the like center for
extended learning, I think it

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,550
was called her high school. And
their started got started with a

63
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,240
project building. Flash games
and action and actions cooked.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,320
Educational. Yeah, rip flash
educational games and

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,430
ActionScript students, and that
was my first. The first thing I

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,790
ever programmed that anyone else
ever looked at. And you know, I

67
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,290
just took it from there.

68
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,270
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
awesome.  I always love those

69
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,240
stories when you have good
teachers who kind of, you know,

70
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,930
notice that in you and, and
they're able to cultivate that.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,540
Cameron Bardell: That's a big
thing what he does at that

72
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,630
school with me. He always gets
kind of identifies the kids who

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,540
are, you know, do a little extra
just because they're interested

74
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,520
in any tries to take them under
his wing. Just super great.

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,730
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So great.
All right. Rahat.

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,630
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, so I got
into tech a little bit later in

77
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,380
life, I guess. So I had a built
up a career kind of in like

78
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,320
customer support. And I was
managing customer support teams

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,150
at different tech startups. And
I got to like work with a lot of

80
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,120
the engineers just seeing like
different bugs kind of get fixed

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,190
whenever a customer would like
complain about things, I guess.

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,780
And that's what kind of got me
interested into the whole thing

83
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,290
at first, I wanted to see if I
could be the one actually fixing

84
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,330
stuff. So my wife is really
supportive. She helped me

85
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,620
through a lot of things and went
to a boot camp and yeah, now I'm

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,580
doing fixing stuff

87
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,820
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That is
awesome. I love it. And so you

88
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,460
both also have different
histories with Virtual Coffee,

89
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,930
Cameron, I feel like I've known
you forever. I remember you

90
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,470
first joining Virtual Coffee.
But I always like to ask to

91
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,050
like, how did you find Virtual
Coffee?

92
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,110
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. So
someone retweeted I think it was

93
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,110
in June, you guys there in
April. Right? Then somebody

94
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,500
retweeted your invite link in
June. And I think it just

95
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,540
replied to the tweet asking you
if it was public, or if it was

96
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,430
like, kind of close thing? You
said, yeah, it's public. Come

97
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,550
join. So I did. And I've been
coming ever since then. It was

98
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,740
probably it was really, you
know, in the midst of the

99
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,620
pandemic, and, you know, talk to
anyone that it wasn't directly

100
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,550
related to a month. It was a bit
of a Savior for me. And

101
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,530
definitely one of the best
things I did and all of 2020

102
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,800
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and
now you are, you're growing our

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,730
iOS or mobile group of
developers, because people see,

104
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,240
yeah.

105
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,290
Cameron Bardell: I was only one
for a few months. Now. I think

106
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,590
we're up to four or five. Yeah.
You know, we're still What is

107
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,810
that? 2% of all the people who
attend, but still.

108
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,020
Dan Ott: Also strong member of
our Canadian contingent.

109
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,160
Cameron Bardell: Right? Yeah.

110
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,480
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah,

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,700
Cameron Bardell: Like, I'm
leaving some niche groups.

112
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,280
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And Rahat.
How did you find Virtual Coffee?

113
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,210
Unknown: Um, I think I've seen
it a couple times on Twitter.

114
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,990
And I didn't join it first,
because I'm 100% know what it

115
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:47,580
was? And then I think it was
Andy from protege.dev. He told

116
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,350
me a little bit about it. And
yeah, joined in into one of the

117
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,090
meetups, I guess. And then,
yeah, from there just really

118
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,270
loved the environment and vibe.
So kept going.

119
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,580
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, nice.
I remember I remember that

120
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,130
conversation now. Because we
were talking about working on

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,180
epic react.

122
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:06,570
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah.

123
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: And we have
a channel for that, which is not

124
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,980
that active.

125
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,330
Rahat Chowdhury: Come for epic
react, stay for everything else.

126
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,180
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: But there
you go. It's our new tagline.

127
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,640
Okay, so both of you have
projects using mental health

128
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,970
tech, and I'd love to talk a
little bit more about those. So

129
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,540
can you just kind of give an
overview about the projects that

130
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,530
you started?

131
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,480
Unknown: Yeah. So there's a
couple, two things that I'm

132
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,650
mainly working on. One is an
open source project. It's called

133
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:47,040
the Sylar project. So that is
sort of like a database of

134
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,600
different mental health
resources in the US. What I'm

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,110
hoping is to kind of like, get
people to help me add more and

136
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,370
more resources to it. And either
in their own states or cities.

137
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,800
So there could be like more
stuff for people to look up. The

138
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
reason I kind of started it is
because, you know, taking that

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,240
step into, like trying to find
help or find resources that will

140
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
help you is like a pretty big
one. And I wanted to make it as

141
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,310
easy as possible, like once you
did make that step to find

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,790
something that could be helpful
for you. So having it all kind

143
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,060
of like in one central place
would be, you know, probably

144
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,250
ideal for that. So yeah, I'm
eventually I'm going to turn it

145
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,310
into like an API that other
developers can like, build stuff

146
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,560
off of. But for now, yeah, it's
just kind of a list. The US,

147
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,240
hopefully, maybe in more
countries soon. And yeah, the

148
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,500
thing is a startup, I'm hoping
to launch very, very soon. It's

149
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,100
called Windsor. And it's all
about cognitive behavioral

150
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,940
therapy, and kind of like
journaling and voice note

151
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,870
journaling, and kind of getting
reminders of like, the good

152
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,930
things that happened over time
and challenging those negative

153
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,320
thoughts.

154
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,340
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: That's
awesome. I love that I was

155
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,440
working on this postpartum app.
And I kind of just went into it,

156
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,220
working on it by myself. But I
reached out to a group of moms

157
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,680
and I said, like, what would you
like to see in something like

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,370
this? And one of the top
responses was resources for my

159
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,040
area. And I didn't have anything
about that there. But also, it

160
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,140
was really hard to find that
online, too. And so I certainly

161
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,700
think that that's really, really
valuable. Along with, you know,

162
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,670
all of the other things,
anything that can benefit mental

163
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,740
health is super important.

164
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,530
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think
there's like a lot of, I guess,

165
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,140
niches in mental health that
aren't really covered in some of

166
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,140
the general labs. So there's
definitely a lot of things that

167
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,450
we can do in this space.

168
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,730
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I feel like
I could talk about it for seven

169
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,060
hours. So try and stay focused
here. Um, Cameron, what about

170
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,840
your project?

171
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,630
Cameron Bardell: Sure. So my
project kind of grew out of my

172
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,450
own personal journey with mental
health, I was doing lots of

173
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,570
research on how people track
their mental health over time

174
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,930
and how you can do, there's
various different methods to

175
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,170
like check trends and mental
health, whether it's like, like

176
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,110
CBT, like Rahat said, or just
like doing daily journaling, or,

177
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,580
and I found that a lot of these
clinical studies use these super

178
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,250
long surveys that can take up to
like, half an hour to complete,

179
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,960
and you're supposed to do them
every day. And that's

180
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,690
exhausting. And it was a time
for that. So I dug a little more

181
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,480
into that, and found that those
studies who use those, I would

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,040
certainly have their place. And
I'm not saying but should be

183
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,910
replaced anyway. But they can
often get similar results to

184
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,970
these other smaller scale
studies that use really simple

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,550
measurement systems and the one
I found that I really liked was.

186
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,320
So it's just really simple, all
you do is you get yourself your

187
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,110
mental well being whatever is
most important to you, on a

188
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,690
scale of one to 10, once in the
morning, and once in the

189
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,570
evening, and you do that twice.
So you do it kind of for your

190
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,640
general overall well being, then
you pick another thing that's

191
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,890
important to you, whether
that's, you know, your sleep, or

192
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,490
your anxiety or your nutrition,
and you rate that in a scale of

193
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,440
one to 10 along with your
general wellness. So you're

194
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,420
basically doing four readings a
day two in the morning, two in

195
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,050
the afternoon, it's super easy
to do you, I, you know, you open

196
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,270
after 10 seconds a day and do
your reading, and then you go

197
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,700
about with your day. So I
started building an app for

198
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,300
that. And I've had to kind of
shell that a little bit because

199
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,180
I recently started a new full
time job, hoping to get back to

200
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,640
it soon. But yeah, I think a lot
of the solutions out there

201
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,440
really intensive and time
consuming. And you're meant to

202
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,350
open the app and kind of spend
some time in there. But I think,

203
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,320
you know, the goal for my app
would be to spend as little time

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,980
in it as possible.

205
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
like that approach. Some of

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,370
those you you look at in it's so
complicated, in that in, it's an

207
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,330
automatic, like I'm done, I'm
not gonna sit here and go

208
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,510
through all of these things. And
watch all of your screens give

209
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,110
me messages and positive things
like I want to feel

210
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,300
Cameron Bardell: it feels like
you're supposed to live in the

211
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,730
app, sometimes, like they have
common videos to watch. And you

212
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,520
know, like maybe guided
meditations, or some of them are

213
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,220
like gamified, where you can
like earn awards and stuff. And

214
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,710
sure, yeah, those work for tons
of people get great reviews and

215
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,010
works a lot. But it doesn't work
for me, I want to you know, I

216
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,010
want to spend as little time
thinking about it. So, and there

217
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,300
was no solution out there. So I
built it.

218
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:29,700
Dan Ott: That's awesome. I was
going to say something about the

219
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,640
Oh, the cognitive therapy yeah
Rahat, you had mentioned that

220
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,610
with your with your startup that
you're working on. The that area

221
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,510
of like therapy has been very
interesting to me. And at some

222
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,440
times, it's been successful, but
a lot of it with me personally,

223
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,860
I want to share my personal
experience. My problem with it

224
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,510
is sort of getting myself to do
anything about it. And this is

225
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,030
sort of applies to what Cameron
was saying to you. But like, the

226
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,820
exercises that a therapist would
would give me would be, you

227
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,520
know, these things that I have
to both remember how to do

228
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,510
remember to do them? And then
also, I don't know, do them at

229
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,700
the right way, or whatever. Or
maybe there isn't like a right

230
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,150
way. But it's like there's just
full of doubt, you know, like,

231
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,220
wondering if I'm doing it the
right way or not. So I was I was

232
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,610
wondering if there's if you have
some plans, with cognitive

233
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,750
therapy, like specifically
about, you know, I don't know

234
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,390
about how to approach like, sort
of things like that.

235
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,150
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think
in our case, probably, cognitive

236
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,300
behavioral therapy is probably
just kind of in the MVP, or the

237
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,430
beginning stages. What kind of
planning to do is like, have it

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,690
be a little bit of a guided sort
of prompt thing, but hopefully,

239
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,930
with not too many prompts, like
Cameron mentioned, which is

240
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,290
definitely an issue in a lot of
apps. So it's kind of like,

241
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,930
choose your emotion. You can
write down something, record

242
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,040
something and be done with that.
Or if you want to, like, get

243
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,740
more insight onto things and
challenge some of your thoughts.

244
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,770
It'll then take you on, like,
guided like two more questions

245
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,860
like, what's a cognitive, like a
cognitive behavioral distortion

246
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,360
that you're facing right now.
gives you some info about what

247
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,080
those are, and asks you to kind
of challenge the thought in some

248
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,750
way. And, you know, if, and that
that journey, I think is more

249
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,060
optional. And sort of like, if
you just want to record, record

250
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,240
yourself just event, it's kind
of like that's an option too.

251
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,840
And if you do want more, more of
that info and more like, I guess

252
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,100
more deeper CBT stuff, then it's
a little bit guided scope and

253
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,200
more questions on that. Our
eventual hope is that the app

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,380
kind of becomes a sort of like a
custom journey based on like

255
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,450
your work with like your
therapist or psychiatrist,

256
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,290
whoever. We're hoping that like
health professionals can like

257
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,430
prescribe a journey for the app
that's tailored towards the

258
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,790
user.

259
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,570
Dan Ott: That's really
interesting. Yeah, that I hadn't

260
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,490
really thought about. I mean,
they don't always like, there's

261
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,440
a lot of apps out there. But not
always connected, you know, to

262
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,320
like to therapy, right. And it's
kind of okay, therapy is either

263
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,560
not doing it for me or, you
know, something like that. And

264
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,890
people are kind of going on in
their own life on to the App

265
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,700
Store. You know,

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,910
Rahat Chowdhury: I think CBT
definitely doesn't work for

267
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,190
everybody. So, yeah, our goal is
just to like, while we're

268
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,510
starting there, we just want to
figure out like, something easy

269
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,560
and simple for people to do that
is helpful for them. And just

270
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,980
based on stuff that an actual
therapist would recommend for

271
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,690
them to do on their own time.

272
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,670
Cameron Bardell: Like Rahat said
earlier, there's tons of room

273
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,130
space very, like very individual
responses. I mean, that's the

274
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,630
whole problem with mental
health. It's the problem. And

275
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,690
the solution, I guess, is that
it's so varied for an individual

276
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,600
for everyone. So yeah, there's
just tons of different ways to

277
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,720
build tools like this. And you
know, part of figuring out how

278
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,220
to control your own mental
health is you might have to try

279
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,870
a lot of these different things,
and most of them won't work. And

280
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,600
that's really hard and
frustrating. But it's part of

281
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:11,930
the journey.

282
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,410
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and I
think, you know, they're all

283
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,800
valuable, because everybody
approaches it a different way.

284
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,310
And I think that technology is
really changing the face of how

285
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,330
we view mental health, I mean,
even openness to talking about

286
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,990
it, and having these
conversations I know, like, in

287
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,890
my mental health journey, it
would not be nearly as

288
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,850
productive as it was, if I
didn't talk to other people who

289
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,050
I never would have met on if I
weren't on Twitter, or online,

290
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,830
or whatever, you know. So
hearing other people's stories

291
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,210
kind of guided my journey and
where I was going, but it looks

292
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,360
different for every person. And
the more we learn about it, I

293
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,050
think using technology also
helps us better identify the

294
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,140
problems and the solutions that
will work for different people.

295
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,869
Cameron Bardell: And the good
thing about using technology for

296
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,969
that kind of things, it's
impartial, like a big part of

297
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,759
the reason why I built what I
built is that like uncompressing

298
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,489
things and graphs and numbers.
And so I wanted to see like,

299
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:18,509
kind of the true history of of
what I was feeling. And so I

300
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,639
looked and when I was doing this
research, I found out that

301
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,179
there's a lot of studies that
show that if you ask people how

302
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,789
they're feeling, at a certain
time, and on a scale of one to

303
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,819
10, like I said, like say they
get a text and they have to save

304
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,309
How do I feel right now? And and
you do that multiple times,

305
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,589
maybe throw it a day throughout
the week? And then you ask them

306
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,529
later on? Looking back? How did
you feel on average, and total,

307
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,079
those two numbers almost never
lined up? How people say they

308
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,439
feel at the moment is not how
they say they felt later. So

309
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,869
that was one of another one of
the reasons I made the thing

310
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,389
that you have to do. And what
you don't have to you can do it

311
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,549
as many times as you want. But
you know, ideally twice a day,

312
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:54,179
and you do it right in the
moment really quickly. It's just

313
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,189
really important to have that
kind of self knowledge and be

314
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,739
able to look back and see things
trending up or down in different

315
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,439
directions. Like my app doesn't
offer any kind of therapy or any

316
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,649
information other than what you
give it. It's just, it's just a

317
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:05,339
personal record.

318
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:08,579
Dan Ott: That's really cool.

319
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,050
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
Cameron, I wanted to talk about

320
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,600
something that you said in
slack. The other day, too, I

321
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,920
think it was somewhere near you
is trying to help people feel

322
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,510
connected during the time of the
pandemic. And I'm always, you

323
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,170
know, found that community is
the most important part of

324
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,430
growing through mental health
challenges. Can you just talk a

325
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,660
little bit about what they were
doing there? Because I found it

326
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,370
like, this really kind of
simple, but beautiful way of

327
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,450
connecting people.

328
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,610
Cameron Bardell: Yeah, that was
a really interesting project.

329
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,420
Um, so it's called, I go to
University of Waterloo, which

330
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,530
is, like common engineering and
science based school in Ontario.

331
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,680
And so I just saw on Twitter
that a couple of engineering

332
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,420
students put together this
project, and it's basically a

333
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,050
heat map of the university
campus and where people report

334
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,170
they've cried on campus, which
sounds kind of funny, I think

335
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,360
it's really interesting because
their, their stated goal is just

336
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,840
to show people, like when you
get, you know, into kind of

337
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,790
worked up emotional state like
that, I think it's really normal

338
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,680
to kind of want to hide
yourself, you know, you want to

339
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,470
make you want to go be alone
somewhere, and you kind of

340
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,050
experienced that on your own.
But, yeah, they just put

341
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,830
together this map just to show
that, you know, if you've done

342
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,560
it, if you're struggling with
it, then someone else's do. And

343
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,750
they've got it's a heat map,
like I said, and then there's

344
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,360
also just kind of some people
did more personalized stories.

345
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,430
So I thought that was a really
interesting project, especially

346
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,410
during a pandemic and we're all
more isolated than ever.

347
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,810
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, that
idea of, of connecting people is

348
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,250
is really important. I think
that, you know, you do sometimes

349
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,020
get in that moment where you
think like, well, I'm the only

350
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,900
one that feels this way, but
just like having a simple visual

351
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,710
of like, Oh, I cried, but look
at somebody right over there did

352
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,160
two.

353
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,200
Cameron Bardell: I'm looking at
the map right now and I'm like,

354
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,660
Oh, look at the engineering
building. I've had long nights

355
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,980
there too.

356
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,990
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I
think that's really, really

357
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,230
great. Okay, so I would love you
talked a little bit about, you

358
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,100
know how you kind of got into
pursuing these. So it sounds

359
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,520
like for both of you, there's
some type of personal component

360
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,510
to this. And I'd love to know,
or if you are up for talking a

361
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,170
little bit more about, like the
inspiration behind this. And if

362
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,010
you learned anything new about
yourself, or, you know, what you

363
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,060
were doing through through this
journey, that would be awesome.

364
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,390
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think,
for me, so the idea for this

365
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,350
client came out of like, my own
personal experiences, going to

366
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,520
therapy, trying to take care of
my own mental health and all

367
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:52,860
that. And, like, the, one of the
main things was like, therapy is

368
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,480
helpful. But it's only 45
minutes, once or twice a month,

369
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,350
or every other week, or
something like that. And there's

370
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,430
all this other time in between,
where just like, I, I'm not

371
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,260
sure, sometimes, like, I guess,
how to take care of myself for,

372
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,990
you know, try to, I guess, make
my mental health better in some

373
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,980
way. So that was like a large
part of the conversation that I

374
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,980
was having with my therapist.
And she would give me like

375
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,630
different prompts and stuff. And
like, sort of like CBT based

376
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,550
things to try out on my own, is
writing stuff out. And it was

377
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,050
pretty helpful. And the thing
that I realized was really

378
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,380
helpful for me was like, when I
in those moments, when I was

379
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,400
able to remember back to like, a
positive thing, kind of related

380
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,280
to whatever I was doing. Like,
if, like, if I was having a

381
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,420
crappy day at work, but then
thinking about another time

382
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,180
where, you know, something went
right at work, that was

383
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,030
sometimes pretty helpful. So
that was kind of like a lot of

384
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,840
the basis for the app itself of
like, having some positive

385
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,700
reinforcement in those negative
times.

386
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,230
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's really
cool. I have I also have trouble

387
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,050
with it the connection between
like, different appointments and

388
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,420
and just sort of everything, it
seems to make sense, you know,

389
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,530
when you walk out of an
appointment, and then a week

390
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,890
later, you're like, I don't? I
don't know. I don't know what

391
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm doing. I don't you know,
like, all the all that stuff. I

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,660
guess a place where like
technology can, you know, like,

393
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,480
really shine? I think if you
know, if applied correctly.

394
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,300
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Cameron, I
don't know, if you want to

395
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,710
share, you don't have to, but

396
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,090
Cameron Bardell: yeah, no,
totally. Yeah, part of my like,

397
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,370
journey with personal mental
health, I guess I started

398
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,060
struggling with anxiety in my
pre early teens, and kind of

399
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,040
kept them to myself for a long
time. So like, I feel like most

400
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,400
of the last several years, for
me has been a process of opening

401
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,860
it up to slowly, like, wider and
wider circle of people. So it

402
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,140
started eventually, like, you
know, talking to my parents, and

403
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,140
then they helped me a lot. And
then you know, from there, I was

404
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,760
like, okay, that worked out
pretty well. And then I, you

405
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,650
know, started talking to a
doctor, and then I'll do more,

406
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,670
as well, this seems to be a
trend. So then, you know, you

407
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,250
start opening up to a wider
circle of people. So my friends,

408
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,250
you know, you guys eventually.
And now here I am on a podcast

409
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,680
talking about it. That's been a
really important part of the

410
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,650
process. For me, we have a Slack
channel in, in Virtual Coffee,

411
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,740
where we talk about these sorts
of things. And, you know, people

412
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,080
have been, you know, pretty
open. And, you know, not

413
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
everyone has to be open, and
just something that happens to

414
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,410
me personally, I would never say
that, like, I don't even know

415
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,440
how to phrase this. Like, I
would never tell anyone that

416
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,570
they should go and talk about
their experiences, because it

417
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,630
will definitely help. You know,
it might not depends, it just

418
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,300
happened out for me. And I only
came to that realization after

419
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,840
like several years of
struggling. So yeah, that's,

420
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,780
that's kind of been an ongoing
thing for me.

421
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,370
Dan Ott: Yeah, that's actually
been a trend we've noticed with

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,560
Virtual Coffee. And not just
with mental health, although

423
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,850
definitely with mental health,
and even just being becoming a

424
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,620
developer or learning, finding,
you know, finding a job, all of

425
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,640
these things that over and over
again, we have people that come

426
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
in or just feel alone in our
field, like they're the only

427
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,650
ones are feeling something's
wrong with them that because

428
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,400
they are struggling finding a
job or struggling learning, you

429
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,490
know, anything, learning
anything in tech and is or

430
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,670
struggling with, you know,
mental things and finding other

431
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,150
people that are also, you know,
going through a lot of the same

432
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,490
Cameron Bardell: And I would
encourage you to say like you

433
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:27,540
things.

434
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,290
don't even have to say anything,
when you're in these spaces,

435
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,570
like you can just go and be a
lurker until you feel

436
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,550
comfortable. I mean, you'll
never feel comfortable sharing

437
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,500
yourself that you can go and see
what other people are saying.

438
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:44,040
And maybe that's something that
could help like that includes

439
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,290
like you know, mental stuff in
the job search and I know

440
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,630
Bekah's been and several other
people in the Slack've been

441
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,550
leading the way on like a
neuro-diversity channel, which

442
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,040
is really great to see. So all
those kinds of things you can

443
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,750
you can reach out and find these
spaces and you don't have to be

444
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,420
sure if it's right for you to
share. You can definitely kind

445
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,880
of hang out for a while and it's
take your bearings, and maybe

446
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,190
just It's not for you. And
that's okay, too. But yeah, you

447
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,570
don't have to feel pressured to
say anything.

448
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,350
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I think a
pretty good other benefit that

449
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,600
comes from that is like, just
knowing that you're not alone,

450
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,730
sort of. There's other people
kind of like going through

451
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,180
similar stuff. I think there's
definitely just like power and

452
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,730
let's like not feeling as alone.
Like, for me, especially when I

453
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,220
started doing talks on it, and
kind of like openly talking

454
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,760
about it. And so like, other
people responding by like, Hey,

455
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,660
you know, I go through this kind
of similar stuff, too. It's just

456
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:36,270
like, it was kind of, maybe not,
I don't know, good is the right

457
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,680
where to save, but more like,
just, it doesn't feel as bad

458
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,620
going through it, knowing that
you're not going to be by

459
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,220
yourself.

460
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,050
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: For sure,

461
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,920
Cameron Bardell: like, it kind
of shows that like, the progress

462
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,310
isn't linear, either. Like it's
normal And honestly in some

463
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,040
ways, kind of important to have
back slides. And then and then

464
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,170
show yourself that you can get
through them. You know, if you

465
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,970
feel like you've made progress,
and then you revert back for a

466
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,470
little bit, that's a normal part
of the process. And you

467
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,690
shouldn't, you know, something
that I like to say is you

468
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,940
shouldn't feel bad about feeling
bad. Like, you don't have to

469
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,960
beat yourself up over your lack
of progress or any of these

470
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,330
areas. So again, it's the
recovery, like showing you that

471
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,310
you have shown yourself that you
have the strength to recover

472
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,080
from something like that is
really important as well.

473
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,220
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, I um,
So my journey into tech started

474
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,010
with a trauma that I went
through. And so I talked a lot

475
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,990
about it about having anxiety,
depression, PTSD, but like one

476
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,560
of the most pivotal moments for
me was when I was in boot camp,

477
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,230
my educational coach, who was
assigned to me and she said,

478
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,380
Hey, can I share a story with
you? I said, Sure. And she said,

479
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,310
I went through trauma, too, I
was run over by a semi truck.

480
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,100
And that was the first person I
had ever talked to you about

481
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,090
trauma. And our traumas are
very, very different. But all of

482
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,970
the words that she were saying,
they were the words that had

483
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,600
gone through my head so many
times. And I finally realized

484
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,520
that I wasn't alone. So I had
spent so much time alone in in

485
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,080
that, that that just moment of
connection was enough to like,

486
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,270
give me hope to keep going. And
that was my trauma was four

487
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,920
years ago. And I gave a talk
about it the other day, told the

488
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,760
story many, many times. And I
just started crying and I don't

489
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,660
ever cry, sorry, on a screen
full of people just crying

490
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,510
couldn't get it couldn't get it
together. And it was that

491
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,120
feeling of like being super
frustrated at myself, like why?

492
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,810
Why is this happening now? And a
talk that's recorded, that's

493
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,950
gonna be on YouTube, right. And
so I wrote a little post on my

494
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,820
trauma blog about it. And
somebody messaged me, and she

495
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,900
said, This is what I needed to
hear in this moment, because she

496
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,650
had also gone through a trauma
and a couple of years ago, and

497
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,790
suddenly, she was like, hit with
that moment, too. And just felt

498
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,330
like very frustrated with
herself. And so it exactly what

499
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,390
you're saying, Cameron, it's
like, it's not linear, right?

500
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,760
Like, there's gonna be waves and
somebody wants said, like, it

501
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,420
doesn't go away, but it gets
different. And I think that, you

502
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,660
know, that might be specific to
trauma. But, you know, we find

503
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,690
these moments in our lives,
where we're like, man, I really

504
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,410
thought that I was past this.
And that can be hard. But when

505
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,530
you connect with somebody else,
and you can kind of talk about

506
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,440
it together, then you realize,
like, okay, you know, like, we

507
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,970
we've got this together.

508
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,760
Cameron Bardell: It can be
helpful, too, if you've been,

509
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,910
like you said, you have your own
words in your head so much. And

510
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,520
maybe you don't know if it makes
sense. Because these things can

511
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,050
often be really hard to put
words to because it's not

512
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,860
something that necessarily has
like a physical analogy for

513
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,140
everyone. So if you can, like
kind of, say these words out

514
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,390
loud, and someone says, Yeah,
no, that makes sense. That makes

515
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,210
you feel a little less lost
sometimes.

516
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,979
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, also,
I think, you know, if we're

517
00:28:55,979 --> 00:29:00,899
talking technology, too,
sometimes. Sometimes you can

518
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,339
deny things to yourself, right?
But if the data is in front of

519
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:09,029
you, like, okay, I've been
tracking my mood for this long

520
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:15,509
for the last, however much time,
maybe maybe I'm not being honest

521
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:21,389
with myself about how bad I feel
right now. Or good. Maybe you

522
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:22,169
feel good, hopefully.

523
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,550
Cameron Bardell: People aren't
good at, um like, I don't know,

524
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,230
maybe you're not it's not that
you're not being honest with

525
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,970
yourself. People just aren't
really not good at self

526
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,590
evaluation. We human brains
work. It's not. It's not

527
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,260
necessarily like intentional or
otherwise, like deluding

528
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,420
yourself or lying to yourself,
or whatever you want to call it.

529
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,760
It's just not an easy, normal
thing to do.

530
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,160
Dan Ott: Mm hmm. Yeah. And that
kind of circles back to some of

531
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,000
the cognitive behavioral therapy
stuff is your brain like, will

532
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,220
actually actively lie to you
about things? is, yeah, well,

533
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,770
like we said at the beginning,
we could probably all talk about

534
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:04,530
this for A long, long, long
time, kind of moving moving on.

535
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,910
So you're both pretty busy, you
have a lot of side projects

536
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,690
going on and along with, you
know, career stuff and family

537
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,910
stuff, school. So we were
wondering how each of you sort

538
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,420
of balance your, your own mental
health, like with with work and

539
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,700
the side projects and everything
else that goes along with being,

540
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,830
you know, a human in the, you
know, in 2021, Rahat, we'll

541
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,530
start with you yet at a talk,
one of our lightning talks last

542
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,220
year was sort of about some of
this. So, I start with you, and

543
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,480
see what your thoughts were.

544
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,070
Rahat Chowdhury: yeah, for me, I
tend to forget a lot of times to

545
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,670
really stop and just like, not
work on all the different things

546
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,760
I'm working on for a little bit.
So the way I've recently been

547
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,370
managing it is just like, trying
to remember that, you know, I

548
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,910
have a daughter, now I need some
time for her, I need some time

549
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,160
for myself, I need some time to
just like unwind from

550
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,530
everything, because there is a
ton of stuff I'm doing right

551
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:12,690
now. And it took it takes a lot
of work for me to like, get past

552
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,120
my own, I guess, self imposed
deadlines on things that don't

553
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,900
actually mean anything. And the
way I had sort of tried to

554
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,580
accept a little exercise I do
just in my head is like pretend

555
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,280
that like I'm a stakeholder in a
meeting, and I'm like pushing

556
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,710
the state back a little bit
like, Hey, we don't need it till

557
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,390
this time. That's something that
kind of works for me a little

558
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,890
bit. And then those moments,
I'll try to like go and like

559
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,140
just take a walk or play some
video games, or anything like

560
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,250
that, and just try to get away
from what I'm working on. And

561
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,610
just like, also trying to remind
myself that if I want to work

562
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,060
quickly through things, then I
need to take a break. Because

563
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,480
I've like gone through burnout
before, like, not being able to

564
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,950
do something for a couple
months. And just kind of like to

565
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,940
me that in my head of like, if I
don't stop sometimes, and just

566
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,920
like take a breath. I won't be
able to continue doing as much

567
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,330
stuff as I hope to do.

568
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,120
Dan Ott: Yeah, totally. I think
that's, I mean, we've sort of

569
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,240
talked about this before, but I
think that that's like a great.

570
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,790
A great thing to do consciously
is sort of try to jam, like not

571
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,680
jam those breaks into your
schedule, but like actually

572
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,260
schedule, you know, breaks in
and make sure you're taking care

573
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,620
of them. Cameron, do you have
anything like, I don't know,

574
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,920
specific that you do to try to,
you know, take care of yourself

575
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,010
all, you know, getting
everything done. And you know,

576
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,680
Cameron Bardell: I guess I'm
coming out with a bit of a

577
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,780
period where I've like been
bouncing around on a lot of

578
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,360
different things. Because about
a year ago, for a long time, I

579
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,880
was kind of torn between whether
I would do like science and

580
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,220
research or just go into tech.
And about a year ago, I finally

581
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,150
decided, Okay, texts can be the
thing. So at that point, I

582
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,520
started doing like a bunch more
freelancing and did a couple

583
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,710
internships and side projects
and stuff sounds like, okay,

584
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,500
here's what I need to do to get
into the tech industry. And

585
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,600
then, you know, a couple weeks
ago, I just got hired full time.

586
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,690
So then that period of like
doing a whole bunch of stuff and

587
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,060
bouncing around is kind of
settling down now. So in back,

588
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,100
it's like reevaluating and
focusing on Okay, here's the

589
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,310
main things I need to do. Like,
I need to do like this much.

590
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,800
Well, I need to work, you know,
40 hours a week, and I need to

591
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,580
do this much school, and then he
also needs to exercise. So I've

592
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,940
been coming out of kind of a
chaotic period and settling into

593
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,480
more of a routine the past few
weeks, which isn't really nice.

594
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,020
Yeah, but I still think that
that period of working hard was

595
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,050
important, because I ended up in
a place that I really wanted to

596
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,510
get and yeah, it was hard for a
while. But here I am.

597
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,499
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I think
too, when you can see, this

598
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:53,309
isn't a forever thing there,
this is going to end then it

599
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:56,639
makes it feel a little bit more
doable. But there's also this,

600
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:00,479
like natural tendency in tech. I
think tech just moves so

601
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:04,529
quickly, right? That people feel
this, this need to hustle all

602
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:07,559
the time. And that's like, I
can't stand that word, hustle.

603
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:13,529
But like to continue to keep
doing stuff all the time. And I

604
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:17,939
find that as much as I don't
like that word. I have a really

605
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:21,599
hard time turning off my brain
when there's always something to

606
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,729
be done because, you know, like,
tech moves fast and so do people

607
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:27,239
so

608
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,780
Cameron Bardell: I really kind
of like it's kind of a strong

609
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,960
word, but I kind of detest that
part of Twitter's like, I don't

610
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,930
know Silicon Valley like VC
hustle porn kind of like if

611
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,560
you're not working you're losing
money. Everyone should be the

612
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,570
founder kind of thing which is
not true. Not everyone should be

613
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:49,560
a founder, being a founder kind
of sucks Yeah, and yeah, I don't

614
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,030
know. I just like it. What you
said about having a deadline was

615
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,910
was really stood out to me
because yeah, like I had so when

616
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,280
I made the decision to go into
tech, I had a year and a half

617
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,620
left in my degree. Okay, so I'm
going to work really hard for

618
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,780
this next year and a half, and
then I'm going to be settled

619
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,390
into a career hopefully. And
having that deadline really

620
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,640
helped. And then when I got
hired full time, I had four

621
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,220
months left in my undergrad
degree. So just to make the full

622
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,160
time work, I stretched that out
into eight months. So starting

623
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,860
in August, I'll be done with
school and just working. And

624
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,400
then I feel like then, you know,
like I said, Even now, I'm

625
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
working less hard than it was
three or four months ago, but

626
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,820
even past the summer, I'll be
pretty fully settled in just

627
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,930
having that in mind really
helps.

628
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,440
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Yeah, and I
know Rahat too, you have been

629
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,040
working on a book. And at some
point, you tweeted that you were

630
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,890
talking about like building a
mental health breaks, which I

631
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,240
just really loved that idea.
Because we're always focusing on

632
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,700
like, you've got to learn,
you've got to learn fast boot

633
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,940
camps are moving people through
quickly, everybody's looking for

634
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,740
jobs. And that idea of like,
okay, you can learn, but let's

635
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,100
pause and take care of you. And
I just found that concept

636
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,600
really, really fascinating. Are
you is that make it does it? Did

637
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,310
it make a place? And does it
have a place? Does that have

638
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,570
that can't do it?

639
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,560
Dan Ott: Is that in your book?

640
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,680
Rahat Chowdhury: Yes, I've
definitely built it into Cypress

641
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,910
I've been writing recently. Like
at the end, depending on like

642
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,330
what subject I cover in that
specific chapter, like, there's

643
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,870
one where talking about like,
trying to find other people

644
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,240
similar, like in the same
journey as you are going into

645
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,100
tech and seeing like, you know,
if you can band together to work

646
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:41,340
on some stuff. And at the end, I
kind of like, I want to have

647
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,620
like a sort of like a normal,
kind of like an alert box type

648
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,530
thing at the end of like, Hey,
you know, reaching out to people

649
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,900
can be hard. talking to people
is pretty hard. Especially if

650
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,850
you're like me have some social
anxiety and stuff. And, you

651
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,660
know, if you've talked to a
couple people, great, you don't

652
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,900
have to keep doing it. Take a
break, just remember to take

653
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,780
care of yourself stuff like
that. And that there's a little

654
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,930
like alerts, like at the end of
each chapter like that, based on

655
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,600
whatever we covered. It's just
like, it's awesome that you're

656
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,870
doing this, but you should also
be taking care of yourself as

657
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,170
well.

658
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,380
Dan Ott: That's really cool.

659
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,970
Cameron Bardell: Like I said,
Sorry, just to jump in quick. I

660
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,430
guess I like these boot camps
and online, different online.

661
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,940
learning platforms, whether it's
Udemy, or like something self

662
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,220
directed like that, they kind of
try to push you through, like

663
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,620
you said, and finish quickly.
And that's they present it in

664
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,020
ways if that's good for you, and
it's not as good for them, then

665
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,260
they can get more people in
charge more people more money.

666
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,420
So yeah, of course, they have to
present that in a way that makes

667
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,170
it seem like it's for you.

668
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,070
Dan Ott: Yeah, it seems that's
actually that's an interesting

669
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,370
point. And in the boot camps,
from what I've heard, it seems

670
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,130
like they're either in a like,
kind of class, like they're

671
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,160
where people are pushing and
pushing, or it's either that or

672
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,630
you're in the self guided path.
And it from what I've heard, and

673
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,790
I don't have full experience
with this, but from what I've

674
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,120
heard, it's sort of like very
much on your own point, you

675
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,910
know, and so you can go try to
go faster, or you go slow, or

676
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,310
you lost or whatever, but you're
sort of like drifting off on

677
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,840
your own. I think, yeah, getting
getting some, some of that

678
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,690
thought into learning, like
learning materials and learning,

679
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:24,870
you know, courses and programs.
It seems very important. A lot,

680
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,590
a lot of people struggling in
boot camps. From what I've

681
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,420
learned over the last over the
last year.

682
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,200
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, that's
definitely like a culture and a

683
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,360
lot of boot camps that needs to
change. Because, yeah, we're

684
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,020
just kind of pushing and pushing
and not reminding people to just

685
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:49,170
take a break. Like, I also do,
I'm a TA at a boot camp part

686
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,530
time. And like, one of my
students was asking me, like,

687
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,460
how do I get better JavaScript?
How do I like, do more stuff to,

688
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,140
you know, keep, keep building. I
tried to work on things every

689
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,450
single day, for X amount of
hours. And I'm just like, take a

690
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,970
break sometimes, and just let
the information kind of sink in.

691
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,880
Because sometimes you just need
to walk away from it to like,

692
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,710
let yourself absorb it.
Sometimes just like walking away

693
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,870
is like one of the best things
you can do to like, solve a

694
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,020
problem. Like there's countless
Simon I think a lot of people

695
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,600
talking about it of like, you
know, you're going through

696
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,180
trying to fix a bug. You don't
know what's going on, you walk

697
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,360
away, you come back and you know
what's going on now? Because you

698
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,750
need to refresh or you need to
just like step away sometimes.

699
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,550
Dan Ott: Absolutely.

700
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,230
Cameron Bardell: Yeah.
Motivation is like a finite

701
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,770
resource.

702
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,780
Dan Ott: Yeah, yeah. I feel like
that. The go take a walk is it's

703
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,830
gotta be like, when people are
having a, you know, when people

704
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,080
are like, I can't figure this
thing out. You know, it's like,

705
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,240
when you're doing tech support,
you know, the first question is,

706
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,150
why did you turn it off and turn
it back on again? Right. And so

707
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,870
when you do like bug support,
you're like, Okay, did you did

708
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,670
you take a walk? Have you
stepped away from the computer,

709
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,750
yet? Separate from the computer
and come back. And then let's

710
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,010
see if you're still having the
same problem.

711
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,360
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: It's so
hard to I think in boot camps,

712
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,660
there's that sense of loneliness
and lack of community,

713
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,950
especially for online boot camps
with self paced students that

714
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,760
don't prioritize community. And
then you you find that problem.

715
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,580
So you can take a walk and come
back and have nobody to ask,

716
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,520
right. And so it's like, Boot
Camps come with built in

717
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,360
loneliness, like, I don't know,
that needs to be advertised or

718
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,900
something.

719
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,100
Cameron Bardell: Yeah. In our
slack at VC Meg was talking

720
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,460
about that. She's doing the self
guided boot camp. And she can't

721
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,800
do it as fast as some of her
peers because she's working at

722
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,380
the same time. So she's kind of
fell behind like the people she

723
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,930
started with just for lack of
time. And then I think that

724
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,240
contributed to some of your
dissatisfaction.

725
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,430
Dan Ott: Yeah, absolutely. Um,
she's one of the people I was

726
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,440
thinking about. Marie was, while
she was on the podcast a couple

727
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,300
episodes ago, but was talking
about, she did a, like the

728
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,090
scheduled one, right, but they
didn't have a lot of support.

729
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,340
And she was struggling. And so
she basically strong armchair

730
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,820
class into doing study groups,
and they all found it, you know,

731
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,170
I mean, they all found it very
valuable, you know, but it was

732
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,250
not a program thing. You know,
it was it was Marie, doing it,

733
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,500
because she wanted the support.
And it turned out other people,

734
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,610
you know, found it valuable,
too.

735
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,460
Cameron Bardell: It's the same
way I pass like undergrad, just

736
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,850
having groups of people to study
with, um, you know, that went

737
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,770
away for a lot of people in the
pandemic, and I can't imagine

738
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,080
what it would have been like, as
the first thing you're going to

739
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,840
do that. And the only way I
passed, you know, second year

740
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,660
calculus is because I was doing
it with a group of friends. So

741
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,310
yeah, I definitely feel bad for
those people.

742
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,750
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: I was
talking to a mom recently, and I

743
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,780
cannot remember she's going
through a boot camp or a self

744
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:53,520
taught, she's doing like a
guided. Can't talk today. Can't

745
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,830
remember if she is self taught
or doing a boot camp, but one of

746
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,370
the things she was saying was,
it's just so hard to find time,

747
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,580
you know, a lot of moms are at
home with kids right now,

748
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,910
because of the pandemic, and
there's not childcare. And so

749
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,600
she's saying, Yeah, you know,
like, I guide, my students do

750
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,970
their schoolwork all day, and
then I say, up from like, 1230

751
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,200
until 330. And then I've got to
get up at seven, you know, and

752
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,760
it's like, okay, let, let's
break this down a little bit and

753
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,970
figure out something that's,
that's doable, and maintainable.

754
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:35,130
And that allows you to get rest,
because a rested brain is going

755
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,550
to absorb the material more,
but, you know, there's this

756
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:44,040
pressure to continue to go all
the time, despite everything

757
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,000
else. And you I don't know, you
can't really strong arm your way

758
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,260
through. Well, I was gonna say
through through lack of sleep,

759
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,650
but parenthood kind of makes you
do that. So maybe you can

760
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,880
Dan Ott: also, you know,
confirms that it's not a good

761
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,530
idea, by the end of the choices
you're making, after four weeks

762
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:11,160
of not sleeping, you can just
see. It's good stuff.

763
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,000
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: So I've
been doing like a deep dive into

764
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:22,980
deep learning and mental health.
And I've been like, very, very

765
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,300
fascinated by all of the
different ways that they are

766
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:31,110
approaching mental health with
technology and how I think

767
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:38,310
that's gonna provide more
individualistic care for four

768
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:42,360
people and a dress, like I
think, you know, really

769
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,010
understanding what mental health
looks like. And so I think that

770
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,830
that's really exciting. But I
also feel like, you know,

771
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,040
there's this this tendency,
like, I'm so excited about this

772
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,480
thing, but you're gonna have to
wait forever for it to come out

773
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,840
and to apply to apply it to your
own life. But I think that, you

774
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,160
know, all of these little things
that bring us hope can be really

775
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,800
useful. I don't know if there's
anything that you found that

776
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,710
you're like, yes, this is really
helpful, whether it's for you,

777
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,840
or someone you know, or for your
projects in terms of tech and

778
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,700
mental health, but I'd love to
hear about it.

779
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,630
Cameron Bardell: don't have
anything, you know, anything

780
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,820
like deep learning or AI or
anything like that, I did take

781
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,650
some of my own trend data and
kind of feed it into a

782
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,990
prediction engine in a
classification engine, just to

783
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,810
see if we can find anything. I
didn't find anything that

784
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,790
useful, mostly because my dad is
like, pretty one dimensional.

785
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,260
But yeah, nothing that I've
used, personally comes right to

786
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,780
mind. But like you said, you
know, we're kind of using our

787
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,300
own experiences to look at these
things. And you said, Well,

788
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,310
maybe it'll take a long time for
these to come out and be

789
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,520
available to use ourselves but
or we could use our experiences

790
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,660
to build them for the next group
of people. And they can improve

791
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,700
upon what we build. I think
that's kind of the dream of the

792
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,660
tech industry is that things
keep improving. Hopefully we'll

793
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,260
see how it goes.

794
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,159
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, deep
learning stuff is cool. We

795
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,669
actually, like one component of
our app is like the whole

796
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:11,939
reminder of something, you know,
relevant to what you're going

797
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:18,809
through right now. And we're
building this with like, AWS

798
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:23,369
amplify, which gives us access
to a couple cool, like machine

799
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:28,049
learning stuff that they have
kind of built in. And right now,

800
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:30,929
we're kind of like trying to
figure out the best way to kind

801
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:35,339
of compare one entry, that
you're not having a good day on

802
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:40,259
to something that's like,
relevant, but you did have a

803
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:44,279
good day on to remind you of
stuff. So while we're kind of

804
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:48,869
like using that, I guess API for
now, what we kind of want to do

805
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:52,439
eventually is probably build
something of our own based on

806
00:45:52,439 --> 00:45:57,509
like, what our users are
actually going through. So we

807
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:00,209
have someone on board who's kind
of like leading that a little

808
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:07,139
bit. And, yeah, I think there's
a lot of room to do some cool

809
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,149
stuff with deep learning and
mental health.

810
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,330
Dan Ott: That's pretty
interesting. I know, I keep

811
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,660
coming back to the cognitive
therapy stuff, but like yet,

812
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,650
like adding that little aspect
into it. And you're saying,

813
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,700
like, for example, you're like,
you're really upset, because you

814
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,460
feel like you can't do a thing
or something. And then the app

815
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,350
can be like, Well, here,
actually, here's proof that you

816
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,410
have done a similar thing. You
know, like six times in the

817
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,800
past, like, since we've started,
you know, working together, or

818
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,430
something like that, that could
be really, really valuable.

819
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,300
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah,
definitely.

820
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,980
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Always, um,
you know, like, after I finally

821
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:54,570
felt like I was a, I had my
trauma under control, I always

822
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,200
would talk to people about this
idea of like, having this

823
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,620
experience in your back pocket,
like, Look, I was able to make

824
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,270
it through this. And it was
really challenging for a period

825
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,930
of time, but I've developed
these tools, or like, I know

826
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,720
that I need community, or I know
that this is going to be a

827
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,310
trigger for me to predict some
of those things. But at the

828
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:21,750
beginning of the pandemic, I
found myself again, frustrated

829
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,670
with myself, because I thought,
you know, so much of what I feel

830
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,390
like I'm going through, like, I
lost my job, my kids were at

831
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,470
home, and I was supervising
their schooling. And I just felt

832
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,560
like really isolated and alone.
I'm like, I have navigated

833
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,860
through this before. But I'm
crying every single night. Like,

834
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,810
what, what, why, why can't I
make it through this and, and

835
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,770
like, ultimately, what I
remembered was, hey, unity plays

836
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,830
a really big role in that,
right. And so that's, that's how

837
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,710
Virtual Coffee was started.
Because I was like, hey, anyone

838
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,760
want to get together because I
feel really lonely. But then

839
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:05,670
also, recognizing that I wasn't
the only one going through the

840
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,790
experience of the pandemic, and
the effects of it, like,

841
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,410
everybody was experiencing it.
And that's very different from

842
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:18,150
navigating your own situation.
And so, you know, I think, for

843
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,870
me, at least, I have this
tendency to be really frustrated

844
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,120
with myself when I think like, I
should have the skills or the

845
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,940
tools or whatever to make it
through this, but also, not

846
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,160
every experience is the same.
And that's gonna vary from time

847
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,480
to time. So there's learning new
things, and there's growing as a

848
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,770
person. And I think that, you
know, being able to share those

849
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,470
things, and the first couple
Virtual Coffee, that's what they

850
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,410
were, it was like, I'm
frustrated, there's a pandemic,

851
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
and I'm very sad about it right
now. But that's what creates

852
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,620
that like closeness and that
ability for vulnerability and,

853
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,470
you know, for for other people
to be able to share their

854
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,460
stories as well.

855
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,560
Dan Ott: Word.

856
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,900
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Sorry, I
feel like I did a monologue. You

857
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,620
can cut that.

858
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,050
Cameron Bardell: No, don't cut
that!

859
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:14,430
Rahat Chowdhury: That was
awesome.

860
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,930
Dan Ott: No, I think it was
great. I just didn't have

861
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:16,890
anything really to add.

862
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,940
Rahat Chowdhury: I'm not sad.
Yeah.

863
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:28,740
Dan Ott: Okay, so wrapping up. I
guess just the last question

864
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:33,600
that is a little more general.
We, in Virtual Coffee, talk a

865
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,840
lot about you know, finding
teams and you know, finding jobs

866
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,440
and stuff like that. So when
you're thinking about either

867
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,160
joining a company or creating a
team to work on a project, what

868
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,410
is what is like a characteristic
what just just like pick one,

869
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,460
but what is one characteristic
that you value in people and the

870
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,790
people you work with? We'll
start with Rahat.

871
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,750
Rahat Chowdhury: Yeah, I mean,
I've been recently applying for

872
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,350
jobs and stuff. So one thing
I've been kind of like, asking a

873
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,290
lot about is like, how the
culture is in terms of like pair

874
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:11,010
programming. I love like
learning things from like my

875
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:15,990
experience steps. So if there's
like a environment for that,

876
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,370
that's definitely something
super important to me. I've had

877
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,500
a couple of companies Tell me
straight up that Yeah, we don't

878
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,350
really have time for that, like,
probably don't want to continue

879
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:32,100
with you then. So, yeah, I mean,
I feel like that kind of like,

880
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:36,180
shows you a little bit about
how, you know, senior devs kind

881
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:41,040
of like support, the more junior
ones. And I guess the overall

882
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:46,650
team dynamic of like, having
that willingness to just like

883
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,530
hop on a call or something with
somebody and help them through a

884
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,070
problem.

885
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,270
Dan Ott: Yeah, absolutely. I
found pair programming, too,

886
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,960
it's, it's sometimes it's a top
down issue, right, you know, so.

887
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:02,460
So like, you could have a senior
developer, be willing, or you

888
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,380
know, willing to talk and
willing to do stuff like that.

889
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,660
But when you phrase it as like
pair programming, then

890
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,570
management gets jumpy, because
two people and two people are

891
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,530
working on the same problem or
whatever. So yeah, I think

892
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,360
that's, that's really important
to think about when you're

893
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,180
finding people to work with.
Cameron, what about you?

894
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,730
Cameron Bardell: Yeah, that was
a good one. One thing I noticed,

895
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,190
I was doing a bunch of
interviewing, I interviewed a

896
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,380
lot of places, even something
like that, I was pretty sure I

897
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,900
would take a job just to kind of
find out what the tech industry

898
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,090
was like, because I didn't
really know. And one thing I

899
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,700
noticed was, that kind of stood
out to me with some places don't

900
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,560
ever talk about like, the
products they're building. And

901
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,020
if you can't really tell if they
care about what they're

902
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,590
building, or if they want to
feel good. And yeah, I just

903
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,290
really wanted to build something
where like, everybody wanted to

904
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,440
actually make it good. You know,
even if it was something that

905
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,220
would just be an internal tool,
or you know, something that's in

906
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,410
kind of like a boring industry,
like, I still want to make

907
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,870
something that's nice to use and
looks good, and sports

908
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,380
accessibility and all these
things. See, I kind of I was

909
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,120
definitely more willing to talk
to people who seem to care and

910
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,450
know a lot about the product and
want to continually improve it

911
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,910
instead of just make it good
enough.

912
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,050
Dan Ott: Yeah, I think that's I
think that's great. I feel like

913
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,470
that's usually a good sign that
like, people are invested in it,

914
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,690
too. And don't have a lot of
turnover. You know, if you have

915
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:21,810
a new new people that are coming
and going all the time, then you

916
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,850
can't like build any connection
to it. Right. So

917
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,450
Cameron Bardell: yeah.
Especially a lot of the startups

918
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,880
was working at I thought do it
all, like, deeply care about,

919
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,220
like the thing that we're
building, but they didn't.

920
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,040
Dan Ott: They deep, deeply?
Yeah. Maybe

921
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,710
Cameron Bardell: the money they
were making? Yeah, right.

922
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,740
Bekah Hawrot Weigel: Awesome.
Thanks for being here. We really

923
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,740
enjoyed having this
conversation. But before we

924
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,340
leave, can you let us know if
there's anything you're up to?

925
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,200
Or how our listeners can find
you?

926
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,780
Cameron Bardell: Sure, yeah, you
can always you can find me at

927
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,050
Virtual Coffee, obviously, twice
a week. You can find me on

928
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,260
Twitter, at @cameronbardell. And
that's where you can see me

929
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,780
doing most of my stuff, kind of,
