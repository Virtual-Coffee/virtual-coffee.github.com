						Virtual Coffee is a community that welcomes people at all stages of
						their tech journey. Our mission is to be a welcoming tech community
						that allows room for growth and mentorship at all levels and to
						create meaningful opportunities for learning, leadership, and
						contribution for everyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						We intentionally keep our group small to preserve what makes Virtual
						Coffee special and support our existing members. We&apos; love to
						have everyone as a part of Virtual Coffee, but we prioritize the
						intimacy and closeness of the group. Our community is currently
						accepting members on a limited basis. As new membership becomes
						available, we&apos;ll reach out to those on the waitlist to join.
