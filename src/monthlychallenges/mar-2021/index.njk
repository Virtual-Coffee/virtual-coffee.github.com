<p class="lead">
    During this month, we'll work on creating, revising, or updating your job packet materials and that elevator pitch that might get you in the door. Each week, we'll work on a new piece, starting with the resume.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For the month of March we're focusing on creating job application materials. Whether you're actively looking, getting ready to look, or just want to update your materials in case that dream job comes along, this is a great time to do it with the community and to get some feedback.
</li>
<li>We encourage you to post your ideas, questions, and even your fears in slack. We're all learning and growing together!</li>
  <li>Each week, we'll do a slack check-in to brainstorm, support, and learn from each other.</li>
  <li>We encourage you to post your ideas, questions, and even your fears in slack. We're all learning and growing together!</li>
  <li>Keep in mind that different experiences will have different approaches to the materials, but we can all provide positive feedback.</li>

  <li>Each week, we'll cover something new.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Week one: resume ->  <li>Step one: find a job post. </li>  <li>Step two: Match your skills to the post </li> <li>Step three: Give a glimpse of your personality.  </li></li>
      <li>Week two: portfolio-> <li>Step one: Create a clear purpose. Your portfolio should reflect the skills you would apply at your ideal job. </li>  <li>Step two: Use a medium that works best for you. </li> <li>Step three: Give a glimpse of your personality.  </li></li>
      <li>Week three: Cover Letter  (CL) or continue portfolio-> <li>Step one: Do some research. Learn about the company and make a connection. </li>  <li>Step two: Do some storytelling. A CL isn't a written resume. It's an opportunity to go deeper.  </li> <li>Step three: Connect your experience to the position. </li></li>
      <li>Week four: Elevator Pitch -> An elevator pitch is a short speech introducing yourself, what you do or your experience, and why you would be a good person to have on the team. The idea is to confidently convey information about yourself in a short amount of time and to leave an impression on the mind of the person who hears it. </li>
    </ul>
