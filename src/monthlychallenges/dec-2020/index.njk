<h1><small>Monthly Challenge for December, 2020:</small> Pairing!</h1>
 
<p class="lead">Pairing is more than just coding with someone else. Pairing is about communication, teaching, learning, positive reinforcements, and growing.
</p>
 
<p class="lead">This month, let’s work together to build on these skills. For this challenge, let’s try to hit 5 pairing sessions per person, limiting your pairing sessions to one Pomodoro session--twenty-five minutes--unless you have made arrangements with your partner. When you’ve finished one of your sessions, report back to the #monthly-challenge channel in slack and let us know how you did and what you worked on! We’ll track how many pomodoro sessions we hit. Before you start, take a look at Martin Fowler’s article <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Pair Programming</a>.
