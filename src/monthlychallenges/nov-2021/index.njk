	</li>
	<li>
		Best Practices. What are some guidelines you've learned that can help
		developers create best practices?
	</li>
	<li>
		Compare and Contast. Have you learned a new language or new approach? How
		does that differ from what you've done in the past?
	</li>
	How to deal with imposter syndrome as a developer?

	</li>
	<li>
		What was your experience like during the first few months of your junior
		developer job?
	</li>
	<li>

		for developers who want to start building in public?
	</li>
	<li>
		How to push through with learning how to code when learning was difficult at
		times?
	</li>
	<li>How to start a freelancing career?</li>
	<li>
		Write about a function or a method: What it does, when you should use it,
		and why
	</li>
	<li>
		A time you successfully troubleshot an error: This can be super helpful for
		those who copy/paste an error message
	</li>
	<li>A simple script in your terminal</li>
	<li>
		A customization that saves you time/frustration in your daily workflow
	</li>
	<li>Keep a journal of your coding journey and then pull topics from it.</li>
	<li>
		Keep a brag board of your successes, or a Time I learned log. Then write
		about one of your favorites.
	</li>
	<li>
		A meta post like how did you chose where you blog, other options your were
		considering before where you're currently set up. Why are you blogging? How
		was the set up process? Features/topics/platforms you're thinking to
		incorporate in the future.
	</li>
