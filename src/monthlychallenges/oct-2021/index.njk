  Monthly Challenge for October 2021:
  <small>It's Hacktoberfest! Participate in open source, learn, and have fun!</small>
</h1>

<p class="lead">
  This month we have three tracks: maintainers will provide issues labeled for Hacktoberfest, contributors will solve issues, and mentors will help contributors and maintainers be successful.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Challenge Team Leads & Facilitators:</strong> Aurelie Verrot & Andrew Bush

<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>The 2021 Hacktoberfest!</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<strong>Maintainers</strong>
<p>
  They provide issues labeled Hacktoberfest on their repository(ies), review the PRs for these issues, and validate and merge following the rules of the contest.
  They also answer the contributors' questions.
</p>

<strong>Contributors</strong>
<p>
  They find issues labeled Hacktoberfest they want to solve. The goal of the contest is to have 4 PRs validated during the month of October.
</p>

<strong>Mentors</strong>
<p>
  They will be paired with a mentee (contributor or maintainer). They provide support either on Slack, during a 1:1, a pairing session, or whatever works best for the team!
</p>

<h2>How to Participate</h2>
<h4>Before starting</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Contributors</strong>: Make sure to sign up on the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest official website</a>, get in contact with your mentor if you requested one, and check out issues on sites with the Hacktoberfest label.<br/>
    If you've signed up to the VC Hacktoberfest Initiative, you can access to your dashboard  <a href="https://hacktoberfest.virtualcoffee.io/">here</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Mentors</strong>: Make sure you include "Hacktoberfest" as a label in your project's topics section (found in "About" on your repository). This is how you opt-in to Hacktoberfest.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Weekly check-ins</h4>
<p>Let's start the week with an async check-in. What are your goals for Hacktoberfest for the week? What support do you need? Do you plan on spending time in the Hacktoberfest co-working room, talking to your mentor, answering questions as a maintainer?</p>
<p>
  Every Friday of the month, you come to our synchronous check-in, share your progress, ask questions, and find help and support. We'll post more information in the #open-source Slack channel.
</p>
<p>Can't come to the check-in? No problem. We'll have an async check-in as well!</p>

<h4>How do I share my progress?</h4>
<p>
  Share your progress in the #open-source channel in Slack. We want to know when you get those Pull Requests (PRs) in so we can celebrate along with you! And if you need support, we'll be there to help you too.
  
   While no other platform is imposed, it can be a good idea to also share on social media for more reach but only if you are comfortable doing so.  You can share on Twitter using -or not- the hashtag #VCMonthlyChallenge, a personal blog, a post on <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a>, you get the idea!
</p>

<p>
  Sharing every time some work is added is a good idea, small progress is still progress. No need to write a detailed blog post; a 140 character Tweet can be enough. For example: <i>Today I submitted my first PR for Hacktoberfest.</i>
</p>

<h4>What if I need help?</h4>
<p>
  You can ask a question in the #help-and-pairing VC channel, ask for ideas in the #open-source channel, or join the Hacktoberfest VC co-working room. Asking for help is part of the process!
</p>

<p>
  And remember, we're always here to help ❤️
</p>

<h4>Completing the Challenge!</h4>
<p>
  Any kind of participation in Hacktoberfest counts as you completing the VC October challenge.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, VC is here to support you during Hacktoberfest but is not an official partner of the event. To get the Hacktoberfest swag, you need to have four (4) pull requests accepted.
