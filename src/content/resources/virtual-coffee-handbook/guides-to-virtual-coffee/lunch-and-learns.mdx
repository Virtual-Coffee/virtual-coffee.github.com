Lunch & Learn talks are usually hour-long sessions on one topic. It can be a traditional conference-style talk, panel discussion, question and answer, a combination, or anything else you can think of!

## What Is a Lunch & Learn?

A Lunch & Learn is a speaking opportunity for anyone in the community. If you want to talk about something, we have members willing to listen and ask questions. No public speaking experience is required. You don't have to be an expert (if there is such a thing), and you don't need to worry about whether or not your talk will be accepted. We're here to support everyone where they are in their public speaking journey.

This is also a great opportunity to connect with other community members as you share what you know. There are different options for speaking that you can check out on our submission form. Our Lunch & Learns Moderator will support you through the process and help you feel comfortable. If you have questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out!
