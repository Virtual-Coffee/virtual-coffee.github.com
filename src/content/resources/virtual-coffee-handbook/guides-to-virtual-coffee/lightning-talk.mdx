Occasionally, we hold Lightning Talk sessions. Virtual Coffee's Lightning Talk is a great way to try your hand at public speaking in a supportive and safe place!

## How It Works

During our Lightning Talks event, a group of members takes turn presenting their 5-20 minute talk. Our Maintainers will share a Call for Proposals in the Virtual Coffee Slack about one month before the event. Nervous about submitting a talk? We've got your back! We always provide mentorship for those who want it.
