			<p>
				Monthly challenge -&gt;{' '}
				<Link href="/monthlychallenges/sept-2022">Hacktoberfest Prep!</Link>
			</p>
			<p>
				We spent September getting ready for Hacktoberfest contributions. Some
				folks are going to be hosting their own projects as maintainers, and
				have been making their repos as accessible as possible. Others are
				getting ready for their first time contributions or gearing up for more
				work in their favourite projects. Some people just want to help, and
				signed up to be mentors and supporters for the OSS contributors.

					Virtual Coffee is tackling Hacktoberfest 2022
				</a>{' '}
				at full force and we want our Virtual Coffee members to join us!
			</p>
			<p>
				Hacktoberfest is a month-long virtual event that encourages and supports
				open-source contributions. Open Source Software (OSS) is code that the
				public can view, contribute to, and use. Sponsored by{' '}
				<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, a contributor
				can qualify for the official Hacktoberfest swag by registering and
				making four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our plan is to harness the power in our community to help developers
				become excited about contributing to Open Source Software, and to
				contribute to some of our favourite Open Source repositories along the
				way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because not everyone will need the same level or type of support, we're
				working to accommodate as many needs as possible. This could include 1:1
				mentorship, access to private Slack channels, a group coding session, a
				review of the project you're using for Hacktoberfest, or general
				community support. We're also here to cheer you on throughout the month,
				whether on social media, through our events, or Slack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you want to be a contributor, a project maintainer, or a mentor,
				we have a place for you! You can sign up with Virtual Coffee's
				Hacktoberfest initiative{' '}
				<a href="https://hacktoberfest.virtualcoffee.io/">here</a>.
