			<h3 className="mb-4">June Recap: Mid-Year Check in!</h3>
			<p>
				We spent the month taking a step back, assessing where we were at, what
				our goals were and how to make strides to the future! Success is rarely
				linear, and sometime’s there’s value in taking a beat to make sure your
				current path is aligned with who you are, and where you want to be.
