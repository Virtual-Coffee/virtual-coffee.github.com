			<h2 className="my-5">üìÜ What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>

			<h3 className="font-italic">June Recap</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge: Reflection!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month the community took some time to reflect, recuperate and
				recenter ourselves for the rest of the year. We took stock of our
				achievements for the year, identified spaces where we could improve, and
				figured out the necessary steps for further growth. Most importantly, we
				sought feedback and support from each other while doing so.
			</p>

			<h3 className="font-italic">July Happenings</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge: Build in Public!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Build in Public! This challenge is all about sharing your efforts as you
				make progress! This is the month for revealing the things you're
				actively working on as you build them up. Anyone can showcase a final
				product but there's real vulnerability in showing yourself in the weeds,
				doing the hard parts. Writing, streaming, Github links, review sessions,
				do what you can to get your work out there. If you don't want to go full
				public eye, you can always just stick to your handy dandy VC crew of
				compatriots. Don't be scared to share! We always appreciate each other's
				endeavours. You can learn more <Link to="/monthlychallenges">here</Link>
