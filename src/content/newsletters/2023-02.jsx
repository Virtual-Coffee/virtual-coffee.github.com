			<p>
				Monthly challenge -&gt;{' '}
				<Link href="/monthlychallenges/jan-2023">
					Month of Learning Challenge
				</Link>
				!
			</p>
			<p>
				The year began with renewed vigor in seeking out learning, hobbies, and
				projects. Virtual Coffee members shared their goals together and
				formulated strategies to make those goals achievable.
			</p>

			<h3 className="font-italic">
				February -&gt;{' '}
				<Link href="/monthlychallenges/feb-2023">Get Job Ready</Link>!
			</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					This challenge is sponsored by: Joe Masilotti, founder of{' '}
					<a href="https://railsdevs.com/">RailsDevs</a>, the reverse job board
					for Ruby on Rails developers.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				It is never a bad thing to keep your job packet updated, and we're going
				to challenge you to do it, whether or not you're actively applying to
				jobs.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this month, we'll work on creating, revising, or updating your
				job packet materials and that elevator pitch that might get you in the
				door. Each week, we'll work on a new piece, starting with the resume.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're focusing on creating job application materials. Whether you're
				actively looking, getting ready to look, or want to update your
				materials in case that dream job comes along, this is a great time to do
				it with the community and get feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				We encourage you to post your ideas, questions, and fears in the
				#monthly-challenge channel in Slack. We're all learning and growing
				together!
			</p>
			<p>
				Each week, we'll do a Slack check-in to brainstorm, support, and learn
				from each other. Keep in mind that different experiences will have
				different approaches to the materials, but we can all provide positive
				feedback.
