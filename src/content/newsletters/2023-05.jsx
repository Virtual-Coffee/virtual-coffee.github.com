			<h3 className="font-italic">April Recap</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge</strong>: Gratitude!
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month we really tried to spread the love around, acknowledging all
				the wonderful people who make this space great! Sometimes we need to
				remember that the most healing and restorative thing you do for yourself
				is to share gratitude and support to the people around you! Thank you to
				all the members who reached out to others and brought more positivity to
				the space!
			</p>

			<h3 className="font-italic">May Happenings</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge</strong>: Month of Pairing!
			</p>
			<p>
				This month we are{' '}
				<a href="https://dev.to/virtualcoffee/the-power-of-pair-programming-benefits-types-and-tips-1h4c">
					Pair Programming
				</a>
				! That means we are teaming up with each other all month to write code
				together. Zoom tuple, Skype, whatever you'd like. Pair programming is a
				great way to learn from each other and solve problems and we're taking
				it one step further by seeing if we can get as many pairings as possible
				as community!
			</p>
			<p>
				For this challenge, members are challenged to hit 5 pairing sessions per
				person. Some ways to get started pairing are on an open-source issue, a
				LeetCode problem, or a project they need help on.
