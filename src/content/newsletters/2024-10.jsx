					Hacktoberfest is here! It‚Äôs been a long road of preparation,

				<p>
					To start the month off in the true spirit of Hacktoberfest, we‚Äôve done

			<h3 className="mb-4">September Recap: Preptember!</h3>
			<p>
				Every year since 2020, we‚Äôve tried to get involved in some way with the
				Hacktoberfest initiative. Virtual Coffee aligns with the spirit and
				ethos of open source and tries every year to be an accessible avenue to
				learning, supporting, and tending to open-source projects.

				October Challenge: October? You must mean Hacktober!!! Time to Open
				Source!
			</h3>
			<p>
				This challenge is always run during October and was our first-ever
				monthly challenge. In many ways, we think of Hacktoberfest as the event
				that solidified Virtual Coffee beyond a pandemic meetup.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have three tracks: approved maintainers will provide issues labeled
				for Hacktoberfest, contributors will solve issues, and mentors will help
				contributors and maintainers be successful.
			</p>
			<h4>Maintainers:</h4>
			<p>
				They provide the repositories with "hacktoberfest" topic(s) and issues
				labeled "hacktoberfest" on their repositories. They will also answer the
				contributors' questions, review the pull requests (PRs), and validate
				and merge them following the contest rules.
			</p>
			<h4>Contributors:</h4>
			<p>
				They find repositories with "hacktoberfest" topic(s) and issues they
				want to solve. The contest's goal is to have four (4) pull requests
				(PRs) approved during October.
			</p>
			<h4>Mentors:</h4>
			<p>
				A mentor will be paired with a mentee (contributor or maintainer). They
				provide support through a 1:1, a pairing session, Slack, or whatever
				works best for the team!
