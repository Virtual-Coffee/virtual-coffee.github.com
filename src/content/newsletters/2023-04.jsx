			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge</strong>: Month of Community
				Kindness!
			</p>
			<p>
				As we work hard to make sure this community continues to be the special
				and close-knit group it has been, this challenge encourages our members
				to celebrate one of the things that continually makes this community so
				special: Kindness. Some of the ways we see this include: practicing
				gratitude, reaching out to support other members, mentoring, helping,
				giving honest and constructive feedback, and continuing to make Virtual
				Coffee a safe and supportive space.
