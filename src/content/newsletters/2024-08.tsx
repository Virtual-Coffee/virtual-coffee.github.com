			<h2 className="my-5">üí° What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>
			<h3 className="mb-4">July Recap: New Member Welcome!</h3>
			<p>
				We spent the month opening the space up to new members. Having an influx
				of new folks in the space keeps the community healthy, thriving, and
				moving forward. Cheers to all our new members!
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-4">August Challenge: Photography Challenge!</h3>
			<p>
				This challenge asks the community to get outside! Go out into the world,
				have some great moments and then bring them back to share with the
				community. We‚Äôre more than our times behind the desk and we want to see
				all the cool things our members get up to. So we‚Äôre asking everyone to
				share those moments of joy and fun and happiness with each other, and
				turn the space into a place of inspiration, wonderment, and beauty.
