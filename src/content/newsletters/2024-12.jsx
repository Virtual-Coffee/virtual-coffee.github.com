					Time for some hobbies! Last month, we went all in on writing articles

			<h2 className="my-5">üí° What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>
			<h3 className="mb-4">November Recap: Writing!</h3>
			<p>
				Based on the NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) Challenge, this
				challenge was the tech and non-tech take on writing and working together
				towards a collective goal while posting on our own blogs. Thank you to
				all the community members who participated!
			</p>

			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-4">December is the time for fun!</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Let's make some space for the other parts of ourselves.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Devs are more than just the code we write. This challenge is all about
				embracing self-expression. Give back to yourself by indulging in
				something just for fun! Share the art, music, poetry, sports, games, or
				other hobbies that spark your joy. We spend so much time grinding away
				on understanding things in the tech space. Let's make some space for the
				other parts of ourselves! In this challenge, we encourage you to spend
				time working on things that aren't necessarily code-specific or using
				code to improve your other hobbies and outlets.
