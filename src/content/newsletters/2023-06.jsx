			<h3 className="font-italic">May Recap</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge</strong>: Pairing!
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month the community was all about{' '}
				<a href="https://dev.to/virtualcoffee/the-power-of-pair-programming-benefits-types-and-tips-1h4c">
					Pair Programming
				</a>
				! We came together to collaborate on each other's projects, share ideas
				and tips, and just celebrate the collaborative aspects of coding.
				Together as a community, we got over 30 pairing sessions for the month
				of May. Thank you to everyone who participated.
			</p>

			<h3 className="font-italic">June Happenings</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge</strong>: Reflect. Reevaluate. Grow.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <Link href="/monthlychallenges">Mid-Year Check-In challenge</Link>{' '}
				is designed to provide an opportunity for Virtual Coffee members to
				reflect on their progress, reevaluate goals, and gain clarity on their
				journey. Let‚Äôs pause, assess, and adjust as we reach the halfway point
				of the year. This challenge aims to encourage personal growth, foster
				connection within the community, and provide a supportive space for
				members to share their insights, challenges, and successes.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this challenge, members are challenged to share insights and support
				each other as we reflect on our journeys.
