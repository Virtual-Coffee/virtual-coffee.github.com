			<h2>Hey Friends!</h2>
			<LeadText>
				<p>
					We‚Äôre ready to write! Last month we went all in on Hacktoberfest and
					open-sourced our{' '}
					<a href="https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/VC-Community-Docs">
						VC Community Docs
					</a>
					! Community members came together to maintain, contribute, and mentor
					to and for each other, all aligned on the goals of open-source
					empowerment and building community.
				</p>
				<p>
					And now we want to take some time as we approach the year‚Äôs end to
					write some thoughts. Our learning, our aspirations, our takeaways, our
					lessons. We believe that everyone has a story to tell and an audience
					that needs to hear that story.

			<h2 className="my-5">üí° What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>
			<h3 className="mb-4">October Recap: Hacktoberfest!</h3>
			<p>
				Every year since 2020, we‚Äôve tried to get involved in some way with the
				Hacktoberfest initiative. Virtual Coffee aligns with the spirit and
				ethos of open source and tries every year to be an accessible avenue to
				learning, supporting, and tending to open-source projects. Shoutout to
				all the folks who participated in another successful Hacktoberfest!
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-4">November is the time to write: 50k words!</h3>
			<p>
				This month, we're working together to blog 50,000 words! Based off the{' '}
				<a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">
					NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) Challenge
				</a>
				, we'll be doing the tech and non-tech take on writing and working
				together towards the goal while posting on our own blogs.
			</p>
			<p>Get those blog posts up!</p>

			<h4 className="my-4">How to Participate</h4>
			<p>
				Once you've written and published your content,{' '}
				<a href="https://airtable.com/app10kd5ewHiLTjxn/shrgRjUFpNjLN1V12">
					add your entry to our VC NaNoWriMo entry form
				</a>
				!
			</p>

			<h4 className="my-4">
				What kind of content counts towards the challenge?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Any tech-related or non-tech blog posts, articles, or novels published
				in November! For tech-related posts, feel free to include code samples
				in your word count totals (if it's a word and you wrote it, we'll count
				it üòä).
			</p>
			<p>
				While we love good documentation here at Virtual Coffee,{' '}
				<code>README</code> docs or anything else you would typically consider
				documentation, don't count for this challenge.
			</p>

			<h4 className="my-4">What if I'm not confident about my writing?</h4>
			<p>
				We all start somewhere. The more you practice, the better you'll get. We
				have volunteers willing to proofread and give you feedback on your
				writing. Just put a link to your draft in the{' '}
				<code>#monthly-challenge</code> or <code>#content-creation</code>{' '}
				channel and ask for the help you need.
			</p>

			<h4 className="my-4">What if I don't know what to write about?</h4>
