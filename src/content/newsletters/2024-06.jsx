			<h3 className="mb-4">May Recap: Community Kindness!</h3>
			<p>
				We spent some time just reaching out to old friends, sharing our
				appreciation for each other, and making space for good conversations!
				And as always, we don't have to stop the energy as the month concludes.
				Taking time to touch base with people we love and appreciate is an
				evergreen way to cultivate the kind of life that restores us!
			</p>

			<h3 className="mb-4">June Challenge: Mid-Year Check-In!</h3>
			<p>
				The Mid-Year Check-In challenge is designed to provide an opportunity
				for Virtual Coffee members to reflect on their progress, reevaluate
				goals, and gain clarity on their journey. Let‚Äôs pause, assess, and
				adjust as we reach the halfway point of the year. This challenge aims to
				encourage personal growth, foster connection within the community, and
				provide a supportive space for members to share their insights,
				challenges, and successes.
