			<h3 className="mb-4">August Recap: Photography Challenge!</h3>
			<p>
				The August challenge asked the community to get outside! Go out into the
				world, have some great moments and then bring them back to share with
				the community. We‚Äôre more than our times behind the desk and we wanted
				to see all the cool things our members get up to. We asked everyone to
				share those moments of joy and fun and happiness with each other, and
				turn the space into a place of inspiration, wonderment, and beauty.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, pets! We asked the community to flood our challenge channels with
				pics of their lovely pets and boy did they deliver! It was absolutely
				lovely and probably a much needed fun time for the team.
