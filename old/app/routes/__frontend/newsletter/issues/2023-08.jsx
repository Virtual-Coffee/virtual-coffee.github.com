			<h3 className="font-italic">July Recap</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge: Build in Public!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Last month the community took on the challenge of sharing our unfinished
				works! As a community, we talked about our works in progress, the things
				we wanted to complete, the things that we were stuck on. We celebrated
				wins where we could, the power of incremental change. A special thank
				you to all the people who participated.
			</p>

			<h3 className="font-italic">August Happenings</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge: Healthy Habits!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				This challenge is all about doing some work on yourself, identifying the
				things that contribute to health, happiness, and forward progress in
				your life, and building back the habits that make them sustainable. It's
				been quite a year so far and we recognise that we can fall short of the
				good intentions we set for ourselves. We're tying to come together as a
				community and get to back to the fundamentals of good health, good
				habits, good attitudes, and gratitude. One of our members, the wonderful
				Jessica Wilkins wrote an amazing blog post called{' '}
