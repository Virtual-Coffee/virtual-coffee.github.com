I was surprised, when opening VirtualCoffee that, despite everything using tabs, it was extremely tight.\nAfter searching my IDE, i realised the .editorconfig specified indent_size = 2 which, considering it is a tab character, should not be needed.\nRemoving this allows the tab size to be set in an IDE level for user preference while still keeping the tab convention.\nSide note: I appreciate this MR is being raised without an issue and is 95% personal preference. If there is a reason I've not thought of for 2 space tabs to be force, I completely understand! 😄\nCode of Conduct\n\nBy submitting this pull request, you agree to follow our Code of Conduct"

So there will be GIFs (or video walkthrough) provided, but how to add them here is to be advised.\n\n\nOne of the steps to resolve conflict is to move contributor's profile details to the last list in the contributors array. This step is necessary because without it, the PRs that are awaiting for review have to update their branch locally and run npm run contributors:generate to regenerate the badge. It will be too complicated and discouraging for this simple project --> this is one of the reasons that the process won't be too clear with screenshots.\n\n\nOnce this PR is merged, there will be another PR following to add GIFs.\n\n\nVideos walkthrough are planned to replace GIFs in the future.\n\n\n\nWhat type of PR is this?
