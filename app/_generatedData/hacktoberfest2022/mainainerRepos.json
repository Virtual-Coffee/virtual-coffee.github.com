You can also pass it in the command line:\nnpx playwright test --workers=20%\n\n\nNew options host and port for the html reporter.\nreporters: [['html', { host: 'localhost', port: '9223' }]]\n\n\nNew field FullConfig.configFile is available to test reporters, specifying the path to the config file if any.\n\n\nAs announced in v1.25, Ubuntu 18 will not be supported as of Dec 2022. In addition to that, there will be no WebKit updates on Ubuntu 18 starting from the next Playwright release.\n\n\nBehavior Changes\n\n\nexpect(locator).toHaveAttribute(name, value, options) with an empty value does not match missing attribute anymore. For example, the following snippet will succeed when button does not have a disabled attribute.\nawait expect(page.getByRole('button')).toHaveAttribute('disabled', '');\n\n\nCommand line options --grep and --grep-invert previously incorrectly ignored grep and grepInvert options specified in the config. Now all of them are applied together.\n\n\nBrowser Versions\n\n\n...
