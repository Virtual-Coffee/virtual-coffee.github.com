			<h2 className="my-5">üìÜ What's happening at Virtual Coffee</h2>
			<h3>December Recap</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge: Creative Community!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Keeping up a VC tradition, our December focus was on making, sharing,
				and creativity. We baked, crocheted, sewed, built with Legos,
				photographed, and everything in between. If you enjoyed it, you can join
				in the fun all year in the <code>#making-stuff</code> channel!
			</p>

			<h3 className="mt-4">January: Goal Get It!</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>üí°Monthly Theme & Challenge: New Year, New Goals!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Setting goals is a pretty well-worn practice for January, but New Year's
				resolutions are notoriously hard to keep. This month's challenge is
				about setting better goals that will serve you all year long, then
				building the habits and tools to help you achieve. Check out the{' '}
				<Link to="/monthlychallenges/jan-2024">VC Monthly Challenge page</Link>{' '}
				or{' '}
				<a href="https://dev.to/virtualcoffee/join-virtual-coffee-in-new-year-new-goals-241m">
					Ayu's blog post
				</a>{' '}
				for more inspiration and info!
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of our Coffee Table groups and Slack channels will have special
				sessions and posts focused on the theme, including a goal-setting
				workshop in <code>#tech-interview-study-group</code> on January 8 and
				some creative goal tracking activities in The Pack Hunt.
			</p>
			<p>
				In past years, our January theme has been "Month of Learning", and we'd
				love to see folks setting goals to learn new tech stacks, data
				structures and algorithms, RegEx wizardry, or tech interviewing skills.
				But this community is more than tech! The goals to find more work/life
				balance, improve your 5K time, or be a better ally are all just as
				worthwhile. Whatever goals you set for this year, VC members are ready
				to support you and cheer you on.
