## Developer Health

#Burnout

Members Sara and Julia gave some interesting responses to a thread about how to cope.

- Let go of the shame of needing a break, needing to say no, needing to pass a project to another colleague, etc.
- Find the activities that really bring you joy and comfort, incorporate those into your week just as you would work meetings or interviews.
- Incorporate some regular body movement. Set some goals to walk X every week, start a 100 day push up challenge, etc. Just do anything regularly to get your body physically moving.
- Regularly assess your week both upcoming and in retro to identify the biggest stressors. This could be reducing hours, taking more breaks, etc.
- Set a hard stop time for every day. Obviously life happens and we may need to push past that, but make that the exception and not the rule. Giving adequate time to wind down every day contributes to a much better nights sleep. Sleep is important.
- Set a day, maybe on the weekend, where you do nothing other than pleasurable things. Play Catan, watch movies, chat with friends, basically just exist on that day.
- This is the hardest, step away from the things that you can no longer sustain. Taking on too much or changes in our priorities happen. Learning to pause and step away from things is important. Trying to do too much will just accelerate burnout. 
- To get different results, you have to change the inputs.  Giving yourself a real opportunity to recover from burnout is going to be important in that process. 
- At a minimum, it’s time to do some self-reflection and breathe and regain some equilibrium.  
- Let your brain work in different ways, to imagine a new approach, dream about new projects, think abstractly about concepts you’ve learned, identify new connections between parts of yourself, reflect on what learning approaches really worked well, and maybe even pursue some opportunities that you hadn’t been considering
