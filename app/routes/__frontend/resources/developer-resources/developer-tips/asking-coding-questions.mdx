Everybody runs into problems during development that can be frustrating and seem impossible to debug. The most important thing is: _if you need help, ask for help_.

We provide this guide for developers, particularly in Virtual Coffee, to ask for help effectively. One thing is for sure, even if you still need to figure out how to ask for help: _ask anyway_! We've all been there.

## How To Ask Questions

### Before Asking Question

- Go through your code line by line.
  You want to know what your code is doing so you can answer questions. Take some notes if necessary.
- Do some research before asking questions.
  You want to avoid asking questions you can figure out by Googling your problem. You can also improve your skill in finding solutions by Googling yourself.
- Check for some typos.
  Sometimes an error arises from a single typo.
- Google the error that you encounter by copy-pasting the error message.
  Most of the time, you can find some answers from people who faced the same error as yours.
- Debug your code. You can check out Nick Taylor's Lunch and Learn sessions below about debugging:
  - [Debugging JavaScript and Front-end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9A0Pifn0Uw)
  - [The Web Dev Debugging Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWisOco_7Ew&list=PLh9uT23TA65idCyc_orC85RefgY_-fKsG&index=2)

### When Asking Questions

#### Getting started

- A simple "Can someone help me with {'{'}something{'}'}?" is enough to start a conversation.
- Be specific about what you're looking for.
  "Does anyone know why my MongoDB authentication failed?" is better than "My app is crashing."
- For a more general question or when trying to grasp a concept:
  "Does anyone have experience with {'{'}something{'}'}?" or "Can someone explain {'{'}something{'}'} to me like I'm five?" is a good starting point.

#### Asking questions

- Specified details as much as possible, such as:
  - What language, framework, or library version are you using when encountering the error?
  - What operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux) and version are you experiencing the problem?
- Provide relevant code along with your question, if possible.
- Explain the command or steps that you run to reproduce the problem.
- Describe what you have tried to fix the problem. It's okay if you need to figure out where to start but share whatever you have already tried/ruled out.
- Read through your question. You want to ensure that your question makes sense and you've included all information needed for other members to help you.

## How To Utilize Slack For Asking Questions

- Unless you are a maintainer or granted permission by a maintainer, you want to avoid using `@here` or `@channel`.
  Using these tags will notify everyone in the channel. It might be an afternoon at your time, but it is midnight in some parts of the world. And we want to respect our members. We are a very active community. Someone will answer you as soon as possible.
- When you are answering questions, make sure to reply in the thread.
  By keeping one topic in one thread, we can prevent confusion.
- Use a single backtick (`) to share technical jargon or a one-line code in a sentence.
  For example:

  ```text
  Can I skip the `h2` to `h3`?
  ```

- Use triple backtick (```) to share a code block and keep a clean format.
  For example:

  ````
  ```
  function greetings() {
    console.log("Hello there!");
  }
  ```
  ````
