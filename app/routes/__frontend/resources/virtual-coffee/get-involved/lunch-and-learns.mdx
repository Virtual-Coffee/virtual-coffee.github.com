Lunch &amp; Learn talks are usually hour-long sessions on one topic. It can be a traditional conference-style talk, panel discussion, question and answer, a combination, or anything else you can think of!

## What is a Lunch &amp; Learn?

Lunch &amp; Learn is a speaking opportunity for anyone in the community. If you have something you want to talk about that the Virtual Coffee community finds interesting, we have members willing to listen and ask questions. You don't have to have given a talk before, you don't have to be an expert — if there is such a thing — and you don't need to worry about whether or not your talk will be accepted. We're here to support everyone where they are in the speaking experience.

This is also a great opportunity to connect with other community members as you share what you know. There are different options for speaking that you can check out on our submission form. Our Moderator will support you and help you feel comfortable through the process. So if you have questions or needs, reach out and ask.
