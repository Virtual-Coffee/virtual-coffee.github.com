## Welcome to Virtual Coffee! ðŸ‘‹

<LeadText>

Onboarding processes can be confusing. This is just as true for software as it is for communities!

We get many questions such as "I have some questions or ideas. How and where should I ask this?" "Do we have a channel for {'{'}something{'}'}?" "How do I find a channel in Slack?" "I would like to help. How do I volunteer?" And many more!

To give you the best experience, and to get the most out of Virtual Coffee, we created the official "Virtual Coffee Handbook"!
