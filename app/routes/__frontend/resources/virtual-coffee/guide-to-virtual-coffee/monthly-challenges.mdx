## What are monthly challenges?

Every month, we create a challenge to provide members the opportunity to learn, grow, and receive support and mentorship. There will be a theme for each month's challenge and weekly goals for the members to work on. Our Challenge Team Leads and our Maintainers plan, organize, and facilitate these challenges. Go to the <Link to="/monthlychallenges">Virtual Coffee Monthly Challenges</Link> page to see our challenges.

## How it works

At the end of the month, there will be an announcement on what we will do for the upcoming monthly challenge. Instructions, resources, and additional help for the challenges are provided in the `#monthly-challenge` channel in Slack.
