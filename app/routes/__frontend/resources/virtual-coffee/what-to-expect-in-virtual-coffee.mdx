We get lots of questions such as "What to expect once we joined Virtual Coffee?" "Where's the link to the today's coffee Zoom?" "How to join a Virtual Coffee event?" "How to find, add or delete channels on Slack?"
This section serves as a guide to answer these questions!

## Coffees (Zoom Meetings)

<LeadText>

We have twice weekly Coffees (Zoom Meetings) on **Tuesday at 9:00 AM ET** and **Thursday at 12:00 PM ET** that last an hour. This is a good place and time to meet and get to know other members, old and new, through casual conversations.

</LeadText>

### How it works

After some pre-coffee chatter, the Coffee MC will do an intro with some background and important announcements while people filter in. Then we'll break the crowd into breakout rooms for more relaxed and intimate conversations.

When we move to the small group conversations, there will be a room leader and notetaker for the room. They'll explain how we do introductions and how to participate. We value our members and the ways they're most comfortable participating.

If you're here to listen and chill? No problem! If you can't turn on your camera or aren't comfortable having your camera or even sound on? Feel free to turn them off! There is no obligation for you to have them on. We want you to be as comfortable as possible in our coffees.

### Joining coffees

We drop the schedule and reminder in the `#announcement` channel on Slack. There will also be an announcement 10 minutes before the event start, along with the link to join. Click that button, and you will be directed to our Zoom.
