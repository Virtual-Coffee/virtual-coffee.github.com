## What are monthly challenges?

Every month, we create a challenge to provide members the opportunity to learn, grow, and receive support and mentorship. There will be a theme for each month's challenge and weekly goals for the members to work on. Along with our Maintainers, our Challenge Team Leads plan, organize, and facilitate these challenges. Go to the <Link to="/monthlychallenges">Virtual Coffee Monthly Challenges</Link> page to see our challenges.

## How it works?

At the end of the month, there would be an announcement on what we will do for the upcoming monthly challenge. Instructions, resources, and additional help for the challenges is provided in the `#monthly-challenge` channel in Slack.
