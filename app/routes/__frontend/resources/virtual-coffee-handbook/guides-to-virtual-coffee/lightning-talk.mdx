Occasionally, we hold Lightning Talk sessions. Virtual Coffee's Lightning Talk is a great way to try your hand at public speaking in a supportive and safe place!

## How It Works

In Lightning Talk, a group of members takes turns presenting their talk in a 5-20 minute time range. Our Maintainers will share a Call for Proposals in Virtual Coffee Slack about one month before the event. And we always provide mentorship for those who want it. So we got your back!
