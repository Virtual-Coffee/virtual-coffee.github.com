## Volunteering At Virtual Coffee

### <Link to="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/get-involved">Get Involved</Link>

As you can see, Virtual Coffee has Coffees (Virtual Coffee Weekly Zoom Chats), events, and even office hours! And these are all becoming possible thanks to our members who run these voluntarily.

If you want to join the volunteer team, check out <Link to="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/get-involved/paths-to-leadership">our open roles</Link>! If you want to share your knowledge with other members through a presentation, consider giving a <Link to="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/guides-to-virtual-coffee/lunch-and-learns">Lunch & Learn</Link> session. And if you are interested in starting a new Coffee Table group, you can find more information on the <Link to="/resources/virtual-coffee-handbook/get-involved/leading-coffee-table-groups">Leading a Coffee Table Group</Link> page.

If you have questions about getting involved in Virtual Coffee, drop them in the `#community-questions` channel or contact one of our <Link to="/members">community maintainers</Link>.

### [Sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/Virtual-Coffee)
