## What Are Monthly Challenges?

Every month, we create a challenge to provide members the opportunity to learn, grow, and receive support and mentorship. Each month's challenge will have a theme and weekly goals for the members to work on. Our Monthly Challenge Team Leads and Maintainers plan, organize, and facilitate these challenges. Go to the <Link to="/monthlychallenges">Virtual Coffee Monthly Challenges</Link> page to see our challenges.

## How It Works

At the end of the month, there will be an announcement on what we will do for the upcoming monthly challenge. Instructions, resources, and additional help for the challenges are provided in the `#monthly-challenge` channel in Slack.
