## Who we are

Virtual Coffee is, and always will be, a genuine community of people who value and prioritize supporting one another. We know that growth comes at all levels and that you can teach and learn no matter what stage of the developer journey you're on.

Our twice-weekly live Coffees with devs at all stages of the journey have grown into an online community that mentors, creates educational content, and provides a safe community at no cost. Since our first Coffee in April 2020, we've added a lively Slack, a site, Lunch & Learn talks, an Interview Series, a Hacktoberfest Initiative, and Lightning Talks.

Virtual Coffee is focused on being a positive and supportive place. Weâ€™re here to cheer you on when you land a job, get a promotion, or write your first blog post.
