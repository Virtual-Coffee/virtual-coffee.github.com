## Who We Are

Virtual Coffee is, and always will be, a genuine community of people who value and prioritize supporting one another. We know that growth comes at all levels and that you can teach and learn no matter what stage of the developer journey you're on.

Since our first Coffee in April 2020, our free online tech community has grown to support developers at all stages of the journey. In addition to twice-weekly live Coffees, we've added a site and lively Slack. Our community mentors and creates educational content in various formats, including Lunch and Learn talks, a Hacktoberfest Initiative, opportunities to practice public speaking, monthly challenges, Coffee Table Groups, and more. We also won the [DevRel Awards 2022 as the "Most welcoming developer community"](https://youtu.be/uIby7vyYHVg).

Virtual Coffee is focused on being a positive and supportive place. Weâ€™re here to cheer you on when you land a job, get a promotion, or write your first blog post.
