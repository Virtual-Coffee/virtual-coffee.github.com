## Linked Issue

_[Whenever possible, a pull request should address a pre-existing issue.
That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or
using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue]_

## Description

_[A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.
It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced,
changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.]_

## Methodology

_[This section explains why the above changes explained were done.
Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.
If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.
A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.]_
